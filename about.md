<img title="Athenea rocking to headphones!" alt="The Podcast at Delphi" align="right" src="/assets/images/thepodcast-at-delphi.jpg" width="300" height="300" />The PodCast at Delphi.org is the definitive podcast about the Delphi programming language, its tools and the people that make the community so amazing.  Episodes will generally focus on recent news and interviews with community members.  A new episode will be available every Monday.

<strong>Your Host: </strong>Jim McKeeth, long time Delphi developer, trainer, author, blogger, presenter, breather, and general enthusiast. ~~Read his personal blog at McKeeth.org and his technical blog at DavinciUnltd.com~~.  He worked for a while as a Developer Advocate for Embarcadero Technologies, the company that makes Delphi. He still shares his own opinions in his blog, podcast and conversations.

<strong>Delphi:</strong> The term "Delphi" refers to the state of the art integrated development environment provided by <a href="http://www.embarcadero.com">Embarcadero Technology</a>.  It also often refers to the Object Pascal programming language it uses.  As a strange twist of fate, it is also an archaeological site in Greece where people would consult the Oracle of Apollo for cryptic answers to life's simple questions.  This Oracle is often confused with a database by a company of the same name that provides simple answers to cryptic questions.  If you didn't know what Delphi was before reading this chances are you are terribly lost.

~~<strong>Podcast hosting</strong>: Turns out Myles Wakeham of <a href="http://www.CyberEars.com/" target="_blank">www.CyberEars.com</a> is a enthusiastic Delphi developer so has had donated some premium PodCast hosting our way.  They provide a very impressive service there that saved me all the confusion of feeds, streaming and hosting audio files.  Naturally this came after I already fried my brain on injecting iTunes tags into RSS and ATOM feeds.~~

<strong>Images: </strong>The header images on this site are actual photographs taken of Delphi, the ancient archaeological site.  They were taken by a Francisco, a coworker from WideOrbit, on his vacation to Greece. Later they were cropped down to really narrow bands so that all the interesting bits aren't visible.

<strong>Music: </strong>Most of the music I use is by <a href="http://incompetech.com/m/c/royalty-free/">Kevin MacLeod</a>, I've also used <a href="http://www.jonathancoulton.com/2006/04/14/thing-a-week-29-code-monkey/">Code Monkey</a> by <a href="http://www.jonathancoulton.com/">Jonathan Coulton</a>.  It is all used under <a href="http://creativecommons.org/">Creative Commons</a> licenses.  Pay attention to music licenses people!  It is important stuff!
