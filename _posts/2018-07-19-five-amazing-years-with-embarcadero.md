This month I am celebrating my five-year anniversary with <a href="https://www.embarcadero.com/">Embarcadero Technologies</a>. It's been an amazing adventure and I am looking forward to more. I saw a graphic similar to the following today and it reminded me how great it is to be doing what I am doing (plus I love Venn diagrams).

<a href="http://delphi.org/?p=3116&amp;preview=true"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3117" src="http://delphi.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Embarcadero-Passion.png" alt="Loving what I do at Embarcadero" width="543" height="543" /></a>

I truly do <strong>love what I am doing</strong>, and I love the people I work with. Everyone I work with inside Embarcadero is amazing, plus I get to work closely with the MVPs, Tech Partners, and all the amazing members of the community. Most of what I do is stuff I used to do as an MVP before coming to Embarcadero. It was essentially my hobby. I would even take vacation time and spend my own money to travel to speak at conferences.

<img class="wp-image-3119 size-thumbnail alignleft" src="http://delphi.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/EmbarcaderoWorld-150x150.png" alt="" width="150" height="150" />I frequently talk to developers who express their appreciation of the work I do as a developer advocate - I love training and sharing what I know. Not to mention all the gratitude I hear from developers for the productivity they get from Embarcadero's tools. The reality is Embarcadero's tools help developers <strong>make the world a better place</strong>.

<img class="alignright" src="http://delphi.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Talking-Android-243x3001.png" alt="RAD Studio speaks Android" width="243" height="300" />I started right before the release of RAD Studio XE5 in 2013, which added support for Android. iOS and macOS were great, but once RAD Studio had Android it was a gamechanger. So many people just added Android as a target to their iOS apps, made a few layout tweaks, and they had a native Android app!

Since then we've added so many great features, plus Linux and the new <a href="https://www.embarcadero.com/products/delphi/starter/"><strong><em>Free</em></strong> Community Edition</a>!

When it comes to monetary pay I'm really looking for a way to take care of my family. Beyond that, my job pays a lot in satisfaction because I believe in what I do. It certainly helps that <a href="http://delphi.org/2018/01/get-ready-for-the-new-programmers/">Software Developer was rated the<strong> #1 job this year</strong></a>. I'm not directly a developer, but software development is a big part of my job, and I work with a lot of amazing developers.

&nbsp;

It's been an amazing five years. Despite a few bumps I am so happy for where we are going, what I do here, and where Delphi, RAD Studio, and Embarcadero are headed. It is always rough when you go through a merger, but the new Community Edition is a direct result of the changes in philosophy that Idera brought. And now I get to work with <a href="https://www.sencha.com/">Sencha</a>, <a href="https://www.ranorex.com/">Ranorex</a>, <a href="http://www.gurock.com/">Gurock</a>, and others that make up the <a href="https://www.ideracorp.com/">Idera family</a>.

I'm looking forward to many more years doing what I love here with Embarcadero!
