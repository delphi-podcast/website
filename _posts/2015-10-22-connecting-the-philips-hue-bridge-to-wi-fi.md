Most public Wi-Fi networks segments each connection preventing communication between devices, besides the fact the Hue Bridge is Ethernet only (Not sure who at Phillips made that decision). Luckily I was able to come up with a solution.

All I needed was my MacBook Pro, which was connected to the conference WiFi and a Thunderbolt Ethernet adapter (which I always carry just incase there is wired Internet access).

Connect the Hue to the MacBook via the Thunderbolt adapter. Then under System Preferences -&gt; Sharing. Select <strong>Internet Sharing</strong>. Connect from <strong>Wi-Fi</strong> to computers using <strong>Thunderbolt Ethernet</strong> (I usually have sharing set the otherway around). Then activate Internet Sharing (and verify you want to do it).

This granted the Bridge access to the internet, and gave it a 192.x.x.x IP address that I could reach from my MacBook Pro (and the VM) to send commands to the bridge. This worked great for my presentation, but isn't a solution for home connectivity.

Also, it turns out the Philips Hue Bridge I just purchased is <a href="http://www2.meethue.com/en-us/productdetail/philips-hue-bridge">now obsolete</a> thanks to an Apple HomeKit requirement.
