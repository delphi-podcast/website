Turns out there are a few ways to scan a barcode with RAD Studio XE5, and no sooner do I make a video about it then <a href="http://www.tmssoftware.com/site/blog.asp?post=280">TMS releases a component to scan barcodes</a>, and then Thomas Krampe sends me his component that combines them all together.

Not that we need another barcode scanning app on our smartphones, but it can be a useful feature for an app that performs another purpose to be able to scan a barcode too.

This video was part of our <a href="http://www.embarcadero.com/rad-in-action/programming-devices-and-gadgets">Making the Connection: Programming Devices and Gadgets with RAD Studio webinar</a>.
