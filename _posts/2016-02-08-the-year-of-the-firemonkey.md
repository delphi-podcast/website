Today is the <a href="https://www.google.com/webhp?hl=en#q=Lunar+New+Year">Lunar New Year</a> starting the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_New_Year">Chinese year</a> of the Fire <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monkey_(zodiac)">Monkey</a>. The first day of the New Year falls on the new moon between 21 January and 20 February, which in 2016 is Monday, February 8th. The animal associated with the year is cyclical, as is the elemental sign. The last year of the monkey was 2004, and that year it was the Wood Monkey. The Fire elemental sign is considered the prosperity stage.

How are you using <a href="http://www.embarcadero.com/products/rad-studio/firemonkey">FireMonkey</a> this year? How will the Monkey help you prosper?

Even Google is in on the Fire Monkey action with their <a href="https://www.google.com/doodles/lunar-new-year-2016">Google Doodle of the day</a>:
