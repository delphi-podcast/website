I always love making minimalistic demos because then you can see all the essential parts. I put together this short video with Delphi 10 Seattle to show the minimal parts necessary for to <a href="http://docwiki.embarcadero.com/RADStudio/Seattle/en/Creating_Android_Services">create an Android service</a>. It is so simple. The Seattle release supports 4 different types of <a href="http://docwiki.embarcadero.com/RADStudio/Seattle/en/Android_Service">Android services</a>. One thing this demo does show that is optional, is it create a sticky service that will relaunch if pushed out of memory. It doesn't show how to talk to methods on the service - there are a few ways, which I can cover later. [<a href="http://delphi.org/downloads/AndroidSimpleService.zip">Source</a>]

BTW, Delphi 10 Seattle added support for <a href="http://docwiki.embarcadero.com/RADStudio/Seattle/en/What%27s_New#New_Option_to_Add_Support_for_Background_Execution_on_iOS">iOS background execution</a> too.
