The <a href="http://ouya.tv/">Ouya</a> is an Android powered game console / set-top box that you can pick up for $99. Not only is it a cheap game console, but it is also an affordable Android platform designed to drive big screen TVs. Easily turn a TV into a wall mounted dashboard or living picture frame.

Once the <a href="http://delphi.org/2014/01/custom-android-adb-usb/">ADB driver is installed</a>, You can develop for and deploy to it with Delphi XE5 just like any other Android device.

This video is from our <a href="http://www.embarcadero.com/rad-in-action/programming-devices-and-gadgets">Making the Connection: Programming Devices and Gadgets</a> with RAD Studio webinar. Check out the <a href="http://forms.embarcadero.com/DevicesWebinar1-22">on-demand replay and download the full source code too</a>.

The Ouya has an SDK that goes beyond what I showed above. I'll be revisiting it with more updates in the future.
