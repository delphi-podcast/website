To follow-up with my <a href="http://delphi.org/2015/02/parallel-for-loops/">Parallel For Loops</a> skill sprint last week (lots of good resources there), today I did a deep dive into the Parallel Programming Library (PPL) including Futures, Tasks and custom thread pools.

Here are the slides:

And you can download my <a href="http://delphi.org/downloads/TaskFutureExample.zip">Tasks and Futures sample</a> to see how to create, start, check and cancel both Tasks and Futures. Check out the <a href="http://delphi.org/downloads/CppParallelExamples.zip">C++ Parallel Examples</a> to see how to use Futures and the PPL in C++.

Until the replay of my Skill Sprint is posted, you can watch this video from Allen Bauer covering the Parallel Programming Library Architecture from CodeRage 9.
