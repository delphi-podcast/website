I've never asked Bob if he actually has a PhD, but I wouldn't be surprised if he does in being Awesome. Either-way, he deserves the Dr. title for all the great work he does on his site, speaking at conferences and in his writing.

Currently Bob is enjoying his semi-annual holiday at Euro Disney with his two kids Erik Mark Pascal and Natasha Louise Delphine. Yes, those are their actual names! So cool.

I've met Bob a few times, once when I was in the Netherlands for the Software Development Conference. That was a great treat, and Bob was amazing to work with. I've ran into him at various conferences too.

The most recent time I met Bob was when he was hosting the <a href="http://www.delphideveloperdays.com/">Delphi Developer Days</a> with <a href="http://www.jensendatasystems.com/">Cary Jensen</a>. I was one of the guest speakers. I love the Delphi Developer Days events because they are always full of great technical content, and it is a great opportunity to visit with amazing people like Bob.

Bob is a great guy and an amazing MVP. You can follow his <a href="http://www.bobswart.nl/blog">Delphi Notes Weblog</a>, check out his <a href="http://www.drbob42.com/events/index.htm">Training and Consultancy events</a>, or his <a href="http://www.drbob42.com/delphi/index.htm">Delphi Clinic</a> for the latest news. If you buy Delphi or RAD Studio from his <a href="http://www.drbob42.com/codegear/Delphi.htm">Webshop</a> then he also includes some of his <a href="http://www.ebob42.com/courseware/">courseware</a>.

Please join me in thanking Dr. Bob for all he does! He is an outstanding MVP and a great guy.
