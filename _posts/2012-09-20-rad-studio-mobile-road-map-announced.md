Embarcadero just published the <a href="http://edn.embarcadero.com/article/42544">road map for RAD Studio Mobile</a>. The interesting part is it will be a "low cost add-on" unless you have software assurance and RAD Studio. There is an SA option if you have the "Enterprise+" edition of Delphi for "Win / Mac / iOS".

If you haven't gotten Delphi XE3 yet then <strong>spring for RAD Studio with SA</strong>. Of course that also gives you Prism and its regular updates. And once you have a RAD Studio license then you also qualify for the discounted <a href="http://www.remobjects.com/shop/renew.aspx#oxygene">upgrade to all three flavors of Oxygene</a> (adding Java and "<a href="http://blogs.remobjects.com/blogs/mh/2012/09/12/p4738"><em>Nougat</em></a>"), so you can get a jump on your mobile application development for <a href="http://www.remobjects.com/shop/renew.aspx#oxygene">$349</a>.

If you don't want the full RAD Studio, but still would like to get started with mobile development today, there is a cross grade option for all Delphi users to all <a href="http://www.remobjects.com/shoppingcart?add=1292">three flavors of Oxygene for just $399</a>. Those super discounted rates are temporary, so jump on them right away.
