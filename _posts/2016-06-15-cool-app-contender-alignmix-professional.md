Simply put, AlignMix is used to divide and map territories. But wow, it does an amazing job at it.

We were using paper, and it was tedious. You would move one line, and then total up the different territories only to find you needed to move another line. At the time I just assumed it was one of those narrow niche projects that wasn't worth creating a software solution. I'm glad I was wrong.

According to Steve of AlignMix
<blockquote>AlignMix is a Geographic Information System which helps companies to design and manage sales territories for their sales force. It enable the user to easily move the territory boundaries and re-assign zip codes (or postcodes) to make the territories fair and balanced. It was launched on April 8th 2016

AlignMix is cool because it's so easy to use. We have focused on giving the user the best possible user experience. Even though designing sales territories isn't normally regarded as an easy and enjoyable task we are getting feedback from users saying they just love to play with AlignMix. You can see user testimonials and more on the <a href="https://www.alignmix.com">website www.alignmix.com</a></blockquote>
