In the meantime, here are some more details and a new sample for you.

These slides cover both Android Services and iOS Background Execution Mode. You can read about the different <a href="http://embt.co/UIBackgroundModes">iOS Background Modes</a> in Apple's documentation.

Luis Navaro published a new sample that shows how to <a href="http://community.embarcadero.com/blogs/entry/download-an-image-in-background-with-android-services">download a image in the background with an Android service</a>. It uses a local service, and launches it with an Android Intent.

Here is <a href="http://delphi.org/downloads/RemoteServiceDemo.zip">another sample</a> that shows how to use the bind mechanism to launch an remote Android service and communicates to it via the Java Message (JMessage) object. There are a couple manual steps that you need to consult the included readme about. Otherwise it won't work as expected. There are three projects in the project group. One is the actual Android Service, then the other two are apps that connect to the project. One of them is the host app that will contain the service within its APK.

Remember, you need to add the service to the host application after building the service. Then you can deploy it within the host app APK.

The DocWiki has an <a href="http://docwiki.embarcadero.com/RADStudio/en/Android_Service">Overview of Android Services</a> and a <a href="http://docwiki.embarcadero.com/RADStudio/en/Creating_Android_Services">Guide to Creating Android Services</a>.
