<a title="Delphi Live!" href="http://delphilive.com/">Delphi Live! for 2011</a> is September 12 - 14th down in San Jose again. Sure to be a great <em>live </em>conference with the upcoming release of Delphi XE2. Unfortunately I won't be there (scheduling conflict), but a lot of other great speakers will be presenting.

Also coming soon is <a title="Code Rage 6" href="http://www.embarcadero.com/coderage">Code Rage 6</a>. This is Embarcadero's own virtual conference. The <a href="http://www.embarcadero.com/coderage/call-for-papers">call for papers</a> is currently open with the conference taking place October 17-21, 2011. I am planning on presenting at Code Rage again this time around. Again I am sure there will be a lot of great sessions there.
