Hour of Code is upon us again. Take some time to learn about programming, or share what you know with others. In this blog post I show how the side CodinGame helps teach Delphi and also provide some resources for those wanting to learn programming.

A short overview to <a href="https://www.codingame.com/">CodinGame</a> for <a href="https://hourofcode.com/">Hour of Code</a>

CodinGame uses <em>Free Pascal</em> behind the scenes, which is based on Delphi. This means it is actually Object Pascal, which is an extension on Pascal. The code I've seen on CodinGame is mostly plain procedural Pascal, but since it is using an actual compiler, you should be able to use full Object Pascal. You will however be limited because Free Pascal doesn't support some of the latest features Delphi does. Still a good learning resource and a lot of fun.

I'm planning to sit down with each of my kids, and probably my wife, on CodinGame this week! If you already know how to code then find someone you can share with too!

<strong>Resources for CodinGame and Hour of Code: </strong>
