When you are showing Delphi to someone for the first time, what demo do you turn to? There is so much Delphi can do there really isn't only one thing that sets it apart. Of course the classic demo is the button, edit box and list box. I've just that one a lot, and it is a good way to introduce someone who is new to programming.

I recently showed off my <a href="http://delphi.org/2015/10/rest-client-video-challenge/">5 minute REST Client</a>&nbsp;demo. That one is a big hit with seasoned developers when they see how easy it is to consume a REST service and then deploy to 4 different platforms. I've done similar demos with InterBase and SQLite, also crowd pleasers.&nbsp;

Another demo that I think goes over really well with seasoned developers is <a href="http://youtu.be/oeMQdvxi560">AppTethering</a>. It makes it so easy for apps to discover each other on the local network and then share data, actions and resources.

Possibly even cooler is how easy Delphi makes it to connect to devices like <a href="http://docwiki.embarcadero.com/CodeExamples/en/Heart_Rate_Monitor_Sample">Bluetooth heart rate monitors</a>, <a href="http://youtu.be/UobNI_oyXnU">drones, brain-computer interfaces</a>, etc.&nbsp;

What is your favorite Delphi demo? Maybe your favorite demo is an IDE feature, like the ability to preview an app on multiple platforms in realtime. Or maybe it is building a multi-tier app to safely share data across multiple devices.&nbsp;
