U.S. News an World Report just ranked <a href="https://money.usnews.com/careers/best-jobs/software-developer">Software Developer</a> as the <strong><a href="https://money.usnews.com/careers/best-jobs/rankings/the-100-best-jobs">best job for 2018</a></strong>. They use data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor and Statistics to rank jobs based on pay, job security, mental engagement, stress, room to advance, satisfaction, and work-life balance. Since you are here, you most likely agree with that ranking and are surprised it took so long for someone else to recognize it.

This means we will see a lot of people interesting in software development. Anyone looking for a better job is likely to start at the top of that list and work their way down until they find one they are interested in. Not to mention everyone who sees the headlines about Software Developer replacing Dentist as the #1 Best Job. Whatever the reason, software developers will get a lot more attention.

When I'm talking to people about career advice I think it is more important to choose a career that suits the individual (internal factors) than basing the decision purely on external factors like pay, etc. That being said, I honestly believe Software Development is only going to get more important. Going forward, software development and related jobs (many of which aren't even invented yet) will consume the many of the other jobs as automation and artificial intelligence take over more aspects of our life. It all depends on which side of the automation revolution you want to be.

When I was really young (like 3rd grade) I knew I wanted to program computers for a living. A family friend told me that I should look for a different job because by the time I entered the career market computers would be programming themselves and there would be no jobs. I remember thinking once that happens there would be no jobs, and someone would need to teach the computers how to program themselves better.

Just recently I was in Tokyo for the 10.2 launch event. I was talking to members of the press, and one of them made a similar assertion "What is the point of releasing better developer tools when soon computers will be programming themselves?" I shared the story from when I was a kid and said that "Yes, AI is automating and consuming other jobs, but the programmer will be the last to go. Once AI's no longer need humans to make them better there will be no jobs for anyone!"
