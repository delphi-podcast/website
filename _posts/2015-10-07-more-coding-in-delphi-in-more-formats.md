<a href="http://morecodingindelphi.com/"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-2055" src="http://delphi.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/more-coding-in-delphi-ebook.jpg" alt="More Coding in Delphi by Nick Hodges" width="284" height="224" /></a>For everyone who updated to Delphi or RAD Studio 10 Seattle, you get a free copy of <a href="http://www.codingindelphi.com/blog/">Nick Hodges</a> new book <a href="http://morecodingindelphi.com/">More Coding in Delphi</a> (At least if you update before the <a href="http://www.embarcadero.com/radoffer">special offer</a> runs out.) Just yesterday this was updated to include the book in <a href="http://downloads.embarcadero.com/item/30323">ePub and Mobi format</a>, in addition to the PDF version. This is great if you have a Kindle (Mobi) or other eReader (ePub) since these formats are more flexible.

So <a href="http://www.embarcadero.com/radoffer">Upgrade to RAD Studio 10 Seattle</a> today and download <a href="http://downloads.embarcadero.com/item/30323">More Coding in Delphi by Nick Hodges</a> and load it on your favorite eReader. Then <a href="http://morecodingindelphi.com/">buy a print copy too</a>, because those are easier to get autographed.
