How are you Delphi programming skills? Want to visit Fortaleza, Brazil? I'm sure it is especially nice if you are in the northern hemisphere right now since Brazil is enjoying summer while we are stuck in winter.

Next week <a href="http://hacknfortes.com/">Hack'n Fortes</a> is hosting a Delphi hackathon / programming marathon. Registration is closed, but you can always head down to watch. If Brazil is a little far away, we have an online Code Battle planned for Wednesday the 15th as part of <a href="http://embt.co/delphiweek2015">Delphi Week</a> 2015! #DelphiWeek
