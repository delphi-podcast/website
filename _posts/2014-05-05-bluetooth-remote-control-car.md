How to use BlueTooth is one of the most common requests with Delphi. During our <a href="http://www.embarcadero.com/rad-in-action/programming-devices-and-gadgets">Devices and Gadgets webinar</a> David I. showed how to browse paired BlueTooth devices and connect to them.

But wait, there's more! <a style="color: #4183c4;" title="while true do;" href="http://www.danieleteti.it/">Daniele Teti</a> &amp; <a style="color: #4183c4;" title="Where is the WOW" href="http://www.danielespinetti.it/">Daniele Spinetti</a> of <a style="color: #4183c4;" title="bit Time Software's home page" href="http://www.bittime.it/">bit Time Software</a> created an Android client app to control a <a style="color: #4183c4;" title="BBZ201 - Mini Cooper S Bluetooth Car" href="http://www.bee-wi.com/bluetooth-controlled-car-bbz201-beewi,us,4,BBZ201-A0.cfm">BeeWi - BBZ201 - Mini Cooper S Bluetooth Car.</a> It may work with other BeeWi Bluetooth remote control vehicles, but has not been tested with any (that I know of).

It currently doesn't have BlueTooth discovery, so once you pair your device you need to update the source code with the MAC address of your car.

I've created a <a href="https://github.com/jimmckeeth/BeeMiniCtrl/tree/XE5/AppMethod">GitHub repository for the project</a>. It should work with XE5 or AppMethod just fine. I've got a version updated to XE6 that exposes the controls via App Tethering too, which I will upload later.
