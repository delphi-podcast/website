I am really looking forward to <a href="http://www.raize.com/DevTools/">Ray Konopka</a>'s webinar on data visualization with Delphi and RAD Studio. Hopefully you will get a chance to join in too!

Join Embarcadero and Delphi expert Ray Konopka to learn about data visualization in a new RAD in Action technical webinar: <a href="http://embt.co/DataViz814">Data Visualization in Multi-Device Apps with RAD Studio</a>. Conveying the meaning of data quickly and concisely is a focal point of today's applications. This is especially true for mobile devices where real-estate and user attention are in short supply. Delphi/C++ and the FM Application Platform, along with native code performance, provide the tools necessary to create vibrant, information rich displays.
