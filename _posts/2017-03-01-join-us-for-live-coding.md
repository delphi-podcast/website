Last week <a href="http://chapmanworld.com/">Craig Chapman</a> and myself launched our first <a href="https://www.liveedu.tv/jimmckeeth/">LiveCoding</a> event. It was a lot of fun, and we are doing another event tomorrow, March 2nd at <a href="https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?msg=LiveCoding+with+Craig+and+Jim&amp;iso=20170302T11&amp;p1=24&amp;ah=3">11 AM US Central Time (find the time in your zone</a>.) We will be on <a href="https://www.liveedu.tv/MrCraig/"><strong>Craig's Channel</strong> this week</a>.

Last week on <a href="https://www.liveedu.tv/JimMcKeeth/">my channel</a> I worked on building a REST client. If you are familiar with Delphi, it makes REST clients really, really easy, but I tried to make it a little more complicated to dive into some of the in's and out's of building REST clients.

Craig has a big project he is starting work on to build an <a href="https://www.liveedu.tv/MrCraig">API Header Auto Generator for Delphi</a>. This will include both client and server side development. He is looking at the fantastic <a href="http://www.unigui.com/">UniGUI web framework</a> to power the web, so this will be a lot of fun.

I am looking forward to see other <a href="https://www.liveedu.tv/videos/delphi/">Delphi Developers</a> on <a href="https://www.liveedu.tv">LiveEdu.tv</a>!
