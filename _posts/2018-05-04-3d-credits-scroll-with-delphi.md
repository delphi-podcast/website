A little fun with Delphi for today's Star Wars day!

This is a pretty simple 3D form with a 3D layout at an angle, and then a 2D layout with text and images is animated up the 3D layout. The only code is populating the labels as the animation kicks off automatically.

It is FireMonkey, and while I only tested it on Windows, it should work on Android, iOS, macOS, and even Linux if you are running <a href="https://www.fmxlinux.com/">FMX Linux</a>.
