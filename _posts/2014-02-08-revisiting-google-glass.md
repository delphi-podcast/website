Few weeks ago I posted about how to <a href="http://delphi.org/2014/01/launching-a-delphi-xe5-app-via-voice-on-google-glass/">launch a Google Glass app with a voice command</a>. The app I built used <a href="http://delphi.org/2014/01/buffering-sensor-data/">buffered sensor data</a> from the accelerometer and smooth animation to show a level. The video below is from our Making the Connection: Programming Devices and Gadgets with RAD Studio where I put all the pieces together.

Google Glass is an exciting new platform and form factor. Éric Bonilha from <a href="http://digifort.com/">Digifort</a> joined us to show interfacing IP Controllers and streaming video from IP Cameras.

Something we didn't get to show is Éric built a prototype app for streaming video to Google Glass. His plan is to build a version of his <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4lQGA8-sO9w">camera surveillance app</a> for Google Glass that will stream surveillance video to security guards on patrol. Additionally it will stream the video from Google Glass back to the security system.

It was so cool how fast Éric used Delphi XE5 to prototype accessing the camera on Google Glass and streaming video from his system to it.

The source code for my Google Glass app, and Éric's code for accessing IP Camera &amp; IO Controllers is available along with the replay from our <a href="http://www.embarcadero.com/rad-in-action/programming-devices-and-gadgets">RAD-In-Action Webinar</a>. I'm looking to pick up a PTZ IP Camera and streaming it to my Google Glass next.
