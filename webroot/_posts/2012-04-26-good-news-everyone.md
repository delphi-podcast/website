Simon "Is-he-actually-human?" Stuart and Jamie "Something pithy" Ingilby are hosting the next episode of the Podcast at Delphi.org. The bad news to this is that your regular host, Jim McKeeth, will not be hosting. However, all is not lost! For the 50th Episode of the Podcast at Delphi.org it has been decided that the tables should be turned on Jim and that he should be answering questions instead of asking them!

As such we would like any and all questions that you might have for Jim, on his development philosophies, his role with RemObjects Software and indeed anything else you may care to ask. Please add your questions on the <a href="http://podcast.uservoice.com">uservoice page</a>.

Accepting questions until May 4th.
