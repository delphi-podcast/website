If you <a href="http://www.embarcadero.com/radoffer">buy RAD Studio XE5, Delphi XE5 or C++Builder XE5</a> between now and the end of the year, then you get both the InfoPower XE5 VCL Grid and components, as well as the InfoPower XE4 FireMonkey grid! The InfoPower grid by <a href="http://woll2woll.com/">Woll2Woll</a> is one of the best grids for VCL application development, and has been for years. It is great to see the InfoPower grid now on FireMonkey. With these two grids your apps can have the best grid ever, on any platform we support: Windows, OS X, iOS and Android.
