I added some more functionality to it as well, although there is a lot more to cover. The <a href="https://github.com/jimmckeeth/DelphiARDrone">component is available on GitHub</a>.

It should work with Delphi, C++Builder, Appmethod and RAD Studio on iOS, Android, Windows and OS X. I'd love to hear how it works for you and what you use it for!
