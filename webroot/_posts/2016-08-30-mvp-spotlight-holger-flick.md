<a href="https://flixengineering.com/"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-2627" src="http://delphi.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/HolgarFlick-194x300.jpg" alt="Holgar Flick" width="194" height="300" /></a>I wanted to spotlight a recent return to the Delphi community as an MVP: Dr. Holger Flick. He's started blogging again and hasn't slowed down producing <a href="https://flixengineering.com/blog">good quality technical content</a>.

Like many of us, Holger started programming with Turbo Pascal and GW Basic. For him it was at the age of 7 (with Basic) and switching to Delphi 2 at the age of 14. In 2003 he became very active in the forums and was a member of Team Indy. During that time he was blogging at "Holger's Thoughts on Delphi," and also wrote several articles in German and Dutch Delphi magazines.

Holger even spent some time freelancing for QA at Borland and CodeGear. Later for Embarcadero he reported bugs on the localization in German. He also freelanced on the Borland and CodeGear Developer Network. Eventually he earned a place on the Delphi 2005, 2006 and 2007 credits screen (<em>Help &gt; About press ALT key and type TEAM.</em>)

Holgar regularly spoke at conferences on Model-Driven Application Development, ECO (Enterprise Core Objects), and ASP.NET (with Delphi for .NET naturally). I met Holger in person in San Jose at the Delphi Developer Conference in May of 2009, and again in Las Vegas at the Delphi Developer Solutions Conference in 2011.

Holger studied Computer Science at <a href="https://www.tu-dortmund.de/uni/International/">Technical University of Dortmund</a>, Germany, and earned his Ph.D. in Engineering at <a href="http://www.ruhr-uni-bochum.de/">Ruhr University Bochum</a>, Germany. He then founded his own IT consulting company in 2011 before joining Korfmann Lufttechnik GmbH as head of IT. Now with his  company Flixments, LLC. and new brand Flix Engineering he is blogging about Delphi development again. As an Embarcadero MVP I'm sure his professional skills will be a huge benefit to the Delphi community and IT landscape in South West Florida in general.

Holger says it was hard to find a recent picture of him without sunglasses as they are pretty much required in Florida.

Join me in welcoming Holger back to the Delphi community as an MVP!
