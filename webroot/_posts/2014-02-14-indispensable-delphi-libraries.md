What are your indispensable Delphi libraries? The 3rd party libraries you just can't imagine starting a new project without? I know mine have changed over the years and we have an interesting new crop of libraries in recent years. I listed some unit testing libraries recently, but thought it would be useful to focus on general purpose libraries (as opposed to visual component suits). Here are some open source libraries I either find myself using a lot, or I look forward to using:
<ul>
	<li><a href="https://github.com/project-jedi/jcl">JEDI Code Library (JCL)</a> - JEDI project started out with the mission of header translations, but has since expanded grately. The JCL is a huge collection of utility functions and classes covering all sorts of functionality. Sometimes I wish it were broken into smaller chunks so I could just download the code I need, but there are advantages to having it all in one place too. The Github repository is updated for XE5. (See also <a href="https://github.com/project-jedi/jvcl">JVCL</a>)</li>
	<li>The old <a title="TurboPower" href="http://www.turbopower.com/" target="_blank">TurboPower</a> projects:<a title="TurboPower Abbrevia" href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/tpabbrevia/" target="_blank">TurboPower Abbrevia</a>, <a title="TurboPower Async Professional" href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/tpapro/http://" target="_blank">TurboPower Async Professional</a>, <a title="TurboPower Async Professional CLX" href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/tpaproclx/" target="_blank">TurboPower Async Professional CLX</a>, <a title="TurboPower B-Tree Filer" href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/tpbtreefiler/" target="_blank">TurboPower B-Tree Filer</a>, <a title="TurboPower Essentials" href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/tpessence/" target="_blank">TurboPower Essentials</a>, <a title="TurboPower FlashFiler" href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/tpflashfiler/" target="_blank">TurboPower FlashFiler</a>,<a title="TurboPower Internet Professional" href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/tpipro/" target="_blank">TurboPower Internet Professional</a>, <a title="TurboPower LockBox" href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/tplockbox/" target="_blank">TurboPower LockBox</a>, <a title="TurboPower Object Professional" href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/tpopro/" target="_blank">TurboPower Object Professional</a>, <a title="TurboPower OfficePartner" href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/tpofficepartner/" target="_blank">TurboPower OfficePartner</a>, <a title="TurboPower ShellShock" href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/tpshellshock/" target="_blank">TurboPower ShellShock</a>, <a title="TurboPower String Resource Manager" href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/tpsrmgr/" target="_blank">TurboPower String Resource Manager</a>, <a title="TurboPower SysTools" href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/tpsystools/" target="_blank">TurboPower SysTools</a>, <a title="TurboPower SysTools for Kylix" href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/tpsystoolskylix/" target="_blank">TurboPower SysTools for Kylix</a>, <a title="TurboPower Visual PlanIt" href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/tpvplanit/" target="_blank">TurboPower Visual PlanIt</a>, <a title="TurboPower XML Partner" href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/tpxmlpartner/" target="_blank">TurboPower XML Partner</a>. This includes both visual and non-visual components, but I thought it was worth mentioning all of them at once. I've used a number of these at different times. Thanks to the work of <a href="http://blog.kassebaum.eu/">Roman</a> and others they are still regularly updated to work with the latest versions of Delphi.</li>
	<li><del><a href="https://code.google.com/p/delphi-coll/">Delphi-Coll</a> is a large collection of collections. The new generic collections introduced in Delphi 2009 are amazing, and this library picks up where they left off.</del></li>
	<li><a href="https://bitbucket.org/sglienke/spring4d">Spring4D</a> and <a href="https://bitbucket.org/sglienke/dsharp">DSharp</a> are the other two libraries that <a href="http://www.nickhodges.com/">Nick Hodges</a> covers in his <a href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/communities/110978417023349293804">book</a>. Unlike the <a href="http://delphi.org/2014/02/delphi-unit-testing-tools/">ones I mentioned before</a>, they are not directly related to unit testing. These are both maintained by <a href="http://delphisorcery.blogspot.com/">Stefan Glienke</a>.</li>
	<li><a href="https://code.google.com/p/delphi-oop/">Delphi OOP</a> - I'm really intrigued by the <a href="https://code.google.com/p/delphi-oop/wiki/Threading">Futures support</a> it includes.</li>
	<li><a href="http://otl.17slon.com/">OmniThreadLibrary</a> - Is the hugely popular and successful threading library by MVP <a href="http://www.thedelphigeek.com/">Primož Gabrijel?i?</a>. If you need some advanced threading check it out, and his <a href="https://leanpub.com/omnithreadlibrary">book on the subject</a>.</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.mitov.com/products/openwire">Delphi OpenWire</a> - I've seen some fabulous demos of OpenWire, but have not yet used it. In fact, <a href="http://www.mitov.com/">Mitov Software</a> has a number of really amazing look libraries.</li>
</ul>
I'm sure there are a lot that I am missing . . . What would you add to my list?
