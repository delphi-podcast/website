<a href="http://neftali.clubdelphi.com/"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-2527" src="http://delphi.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/German-Estevez-Ruiz.jpg" alt="German Estevez Ruiz" width="128" height="170" /></a>This week I am spotlighting Germán "Neftalí" Estévez from Barcelona, Spain. He is a regular contributor on the <a href="http://www.ClubDelphi.com/">ClubDelphi</a> forms, which he also administers. You can also find him on <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/17487/">Stack Overflow</a>.

But I want to highlight a couple of his recent blog posts which can be found at <a href="http://neftali.clubdelphi.com/">neftali.clubdelphi.com</a> and althought he's started blogging on <a href="http://community.embarcadero.com/blogs/blogger/listings/german-estevez">community.embarcadero.com</a> too. His blog posts are in Spanish, but Google Translate takes care of most the heavy lifting, and his code samples are in the common Delphi.
<h2><a href="http://community.embarcadero.com/blogs/entry/cuestion-de-volumen-1">Managing Audio on Android</a></h2>
This is a great guide to managing the hardware on Android. It shows how to work directly with the Audio Manager via the Java bridge. This is also useful if you are not familiar with using Android APIs directly.
<h2><a href="http://neftali.clubdelphi.com/?p=4007">The NASA Astronomy Picture of the Day</a></h2>
This is something I've thought about doing in the past. The <a href="http://apod.nasa.gov/apod/astropix.html">APOD is a great new photo everyday</a>. Turns out they have a web service you can use to access that picture. Germán shows how to access the web service, then download and display the pictures.

One thing I like is he includes short videos with many of his blog posts, as well as source code download.
