<a href="https://1password.com/">1Password</a> just won the <a href="http://community.embarcadero.com/blogs/entry/join-our-club-of-elite-embarcadero-developers-show-us-your-cool-apps">Embarcadero Cool App Contest.</a> It is a really cool app, and written in Delphi. You can <a href="http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20160526005914/en">check out the press release</a> or the <a href="http://community.embarcadero.com/article/news/16234-1password-for-windows-is-the-1st-winner-of-the-cool-app-contest-2">article about it</a>. I also have a little video I made with the Stefan van As (the Developer) and Mark Eaton (QA).

I've been using LassPass, EverNote, Google Authenticator, Authy and Chrome's identity management previously, but wasn't completely happy with that. After looking at 1Password I am switching. It is really fantastic, and includes all the features I need.

Who will win next month? Maybe your cool app. <a href="http://community.embarcadero.com/blogs/entry/join-our-club-of-elite-embarcadero-developers-show-us-your-cool-apps">Enter today</a>!
