People have asked for a copy of the utility I wrote to view the attached Android device on the screen. It uses the built in <em>screencap</em> functionality of Android and the ADB (Android Debug Bridge) to grab and display a series of screenshots. It requires the Android SDK installed and does not require a rooted device.

The speed of update has to do with the screen resolution and image complexity. Simple screens (text and controls) update about twice a second. More complex screens (pictures, graphics, etc.) are slower than that.

For best results, turn on "Show Touches" under debug options.

It also supports saving a PNG to file.

There are a few pending features that I just haven't gotten to. If you'd like to contribute let me know. Thanks to Stephen Ball for all his contributions already!
