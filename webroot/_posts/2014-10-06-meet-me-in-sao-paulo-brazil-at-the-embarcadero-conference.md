Last year was my first visit to the <a href="http://www.embarcaderoconference.com.br/">Embarcadero Conference</a> in <a class="zem_slink" title="São Paulo" href="http://maps.google.com/maps?ll=-23.55,-46.6333333333&amp;spn=0.1,0.1&amp;q=-23.55,-46.6333333333 (S%C3%A3o%20Paulo)&amp;t=h" target="_blank" rel="geolocation">São Paulo, Brazil</a> and I loved it. So I am going back again this year. As an added treat I'm be <a href="http://www.embarcaderoconference.com.br/agenda.html">joining Marco Canto</a>, the Delphi product manager. We both speak together on <em><strong>Delphi Present and Future</strong></em>, then Marco does <em><strong>The Fun Side of Delphi</strong></em> and later I'll cover <em><strong>Internet of Things, Bluetooth and AppTethering</strong></em> when I will also show some Delphi powered Brain-Computer Interface demos and a lucky volunteer will fly a quadricopter with their thoughts.

The Embarcadero Conference in Brazil is huge with a lot of great sessions. I always consider it a treat when I get to see Marco's <em><strong>Fun Side of Delphi</strong></em> presentation. I wonder if he will show off the Elf &amp; Wizard classes that are new in XE7?
