<a href="http://sadelphiitschools.blogspot.com/"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-2423" src="http://delphi.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Albertus.jpg" alt="Bertie Buitendag" width="200" /></a>This week we are spotlighting the work of <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/bertie-buitendag-a9914219">Bertie Buitendag,</a> our MVP from South Africa. He is a lecturer at <a href="http://www.tut.ac.za/">Tshwane University of Technology</a>. He was instrumental in the school system adopting Delphi for early education. He also worked to develop the curriculum for teaching computer programming in basic education.

If you check out <a href="http://sadelphiitschools.blogspot.co.za/">his blog</a>, he regularly blogs about educational events in South Africa where students and faculty learn more about Delphi. If you check out his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyU5R32Y2p_AVSRnXT0BCDg/videos?sort=dd&amp;view=0&amp;shelf_id=0">YouTube Channel</a> you can see some of the videos he's put together covering different topics on Delphi.

You can also see Bertie and some of his students from South Africa in the recent <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpUsdg05cUo">Inspire, Develop, Excel video</a>.

If you are interested you can check out the <a href="http://delphi.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/IT-Tools-Standardisation-Implementation-Plan-Delphi.pdf">Implementation Plan for Standardising Programming Language for Information Technology for 2015</a> that provides the argument for using Delphi in schools. It provides a lot of great points.

It was unfortunate that a few schools insisted on staying on Java, but most of them are now standardized on Delphi thanks to Bertie!
