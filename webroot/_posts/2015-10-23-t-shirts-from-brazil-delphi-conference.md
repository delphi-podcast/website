I picked up some great T-Shirts during my visit to Brazil.

I really like this one as the Delphi Developer is the highest evolved form of developer. This is evident by not only their great taste in development tools, but also by the fact they are incredibly productive and produce great apps for all the platforms.

To run it, please fill with coffee and press F9.[/caption]

I'll take some <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guaran%C3%A1_Antarctica">Guaraná Antarctica</a> instead of coffee though. Just not sure where my F9 key is located. <a href="http://www.taturs.com/">Carlos</a> from Aquasoft showed me a very cool ORM he is working on. Hopefully we will see some more of that in the near future.

I love that Windows, Apple and Android are all following the Delphi Developer.
