<a href="http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2013/08/my-boss-just-gave-me-a-warning-is-there-a-way-to-get-faster-at-solving-bugs/">Ars Technica</a> has compiled some tips for solving bugs quicker from a question on <a href="http://programmers.stackexchange.com/q/197675/433">Programmers Stack Exchange</a>. Here are the highlights:
<ul>

Danny Thorpe, former Borland Chief Scientist, had a conference session on <em>Reading Tea Leaves: The Fine Art of Debugging</em>. Luckily <a href="http://blog.excastle.com/2005/11/08/reading-tea-leaves-the-fine-art-of-debugging/">Joe White took some great notes</a>, and Danny revisited some of his tips in another <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/2768002/255">Stack Overflow answer</a>.

I'm curious what tips and techniques you have for solving bugs, especially those really nasty ones. Are there specific tools your use? I know there is a lot of functionality in the Delphi debugger, much of which is rarely used to its fullest potential.
