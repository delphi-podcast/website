The world of Delphi is HUGE. It love seeing all the different types of apps being built and seeing users all over the world. This week I was in Tokyo for their <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/0315INTOKYO">#0315inTokyo</a> event announcing 10.2 Tokyo <em>coming soon</em>. In a surprising turn of events Eric Bonilha of <a href="http://www.digifort.com">Digifort</a> from Brazil was in Tokyo on vacation too.

He stopped by the Tokyo office of Embarcadero for a quick visit. He showed off the latest version of his <a href="https://www.embarcadero.com/case-study/digifort-ip-surveillance-system-case-study">Digifort Mobile client</a> and the engineers here showed him some of the things they are working on with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRqFYQrxY9o&amp;vl=en">BeaconFence for a local museum</a>. A lot of fun.

We are all excited for the upcoming 10.2 Tokyo release adding support for Linux!

It is happenstance meetings like this that show how global Delphi and Embarcadero really are.

<strong>Go Delphi!</strong>
