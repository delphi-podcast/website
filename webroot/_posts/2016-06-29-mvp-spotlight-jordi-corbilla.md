<a href="http://thundaxsoftware.blogspot.co.uk/"><img class="alignright wp-image-2538" src="http://delphi.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/jordi_coll.jpg" alt="Jordi Corbilla" width="251" height="251" /></a>This week I wanted to spotlight Jordi Corbilla of London, UK in our Embarcadero MVP Spotlight. Jordi has a fantastic blog <em><a href="http://thundaxsoftware.blogspot.co.uk/">Random thoughts on coding and technology</a></em> where he has some recent posts on working with <a href="http://thundaxsoftware.blogspot.co.uk/2016/06/baas-with-kinvey-and-delphi-101-berlin.html">Kinvey</a>, <a href="http://thundaxsoftware.blogspot.co.uk/2016/05/creating-your-own-self-hosted-parse.html">Parse</a> and BaaS in general.

Beyond BaaS, Jordi is interested in Databases and Artificial Intelligence. He has a GibHub project that contains a <a href="https://github.com/JordiCorbilla/thundax-ai">series of A.I. Algorithms programmed in Delphi</a>. He also has a <a href="https://github.com/JordiCorbilla/DDM">Distributed Decision-Making System</a> and a <a href="https://github.com/JordiCorbilla/naturalAI">Natural AI in Python</a>. I was also looking at his <a href="https://github.com/JordiCorbilla/thundax-delphi-physics-engine">2D Physics Engine</a>, but that isn't necessarily AI related.

I fancy myself a photographer, but it is just a little hobby for me. I tried a selfie similar to his at the left a long time ago, but it didn't come out as well (I doubt I still have it).

Jordi is a pretty amazing photographer. I rather like <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/jordicorbillaphotography/17412874003/in/photolist-swHwMz">this photo</a> (mostly for the subject matter) . . .

But he has a lot of other great photos on his <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/jordicorbillaphotography/">Flickr</a> and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/JordiCorbillaPhotography/">Facebook</a>.
