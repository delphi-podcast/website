Topics include the upcoming <a href="http://www.delphideveloperdays.com/">Delphi Developer Days</a>, some of his work for <a href="https://disneyworld.disney.go.com/plan/my-disney-experience/fastpass-plus/">Disney</a>, <a href="http://www.raize.com/">Raize Software</a>, including his new <a href="http://www.raize.com/DevTools/RadiantShapes/">Radiant Shapes</a>, <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/about">Windows 10</a> and <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-hololens">HoloLense</a> (even though I wish they would rename it).

Looking forward to seeing everyone at Delphi Developer Days in Chicago, but if you can't meet me there, they have some other locations too.
