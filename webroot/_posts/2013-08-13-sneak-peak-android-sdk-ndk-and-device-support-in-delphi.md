A juicy sneak peek of the Android support in the SDK Manager and Project manager being developed in the beta. This video shows the updates to the SDK Manager to support the Android SDK &amp; NDK. These can be installed and configured automatically, or you can install them on your own and configure them here. Then it shows how easy it is to add Android as a target. The project manager will automatically detect any Android Emulators or devices with USB debugging enabled and provide them as an option.
