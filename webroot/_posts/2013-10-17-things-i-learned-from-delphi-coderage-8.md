Mostly from <a href="http://thecoderage.com">CodeRage 8</a>, but some is from my time working for <a href="http://www.embarcadero.com/">Embarcadero</a>. I believe I've presented at every CodeRage, but this is my first time on the other side. It is also the biggest CodeRage by a significant margin. I'm sure the two events are unrelated, but it is still exciting.
<ul>
	<li>Delphi can do functional programming, and it is really cool.</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.jensendatasystems.com/">Cary Jensen</a> is really excited about <a href="http://www.embarcadero.com/products/rad-studio/firedac">FireDAC</a> - and so is everyone else, because FireDAC is really cool. He's so excited he might cut his hair off . . .</li>
	<li>There are a lot of really smart and very nice people working for Embarcadero.</li>
	<li>No matter how easy you find it to understand someone, there is somebody else who has a hard time with their accent, speed, or terminology.</li>
	<li>There is still more that I don't know about Delphi then I do. And I think that is a good thing.</li>
	<li>You really shouldn't use "with" in your code, especially during a presentation that occurred <em>after</em> <a href="http://learndelphi.tv">Alister Christie</a>'s session on "anti-patterns."</li>
	<li>The Tag property is useful, but no one wants to admit it.</li>
	<li>Delphi makes it easy to make nice UI and ugly UI. I like that it is flexible.</li>
	<li>If you use something wrong it will be slow. If you test you can probably find a faster way.</li>
	<li>Two people can present on the same thing and have different sessions while two other people can present on two different things and have surprising overlaps.</li>
	<li>REST and JSON are great, but XML and SOAP are still around and in use.</li>
	<li>If you want to scroll it, use a TListView. Otherwise use a TListBox.</li>
	<li>When it comes to making custom controls, in any framework, <a href="http://raize.com">Ray</a> is still the guy.</li>
	<li>It is a lot more work than I expected to run CodeRage, but also a lot more fun.</li>
	<li>If you know what you are doing, it is pretty easy to access any iOS or Android API from Delphi.</li>
	<li>You can use FireMonkey to make a pretty good mobile game, but it still isn't recommended.</li>
	<li>Encrypt your customer's data, or you can get a huge fine.</li>
	<li>Everyone always likes a good benchmark or comparison, but they don't really tell you anything.</li>
	<li>David I. really is as great of a guy as everyone says he is, but even 3 days of CodeRage will wear him out.</li>
	<li>The Android Emulator is really slow and unresponsive, and no one seems to know why.</li>
	<li>There usually is more than one way to do something. And just when I think I realized a smart way to do something, someone else will point out an easier way.</li>
	<li>Replay videos are never online fast enough.</li>
	<li>Making a good video to explain a technical topic is way more work than anyone realizes, even people who have done it a hundred times. And when you are done you are rarely satisfied with it.</li>
	<li>GoToWebinar is a pain, but so far it seems to be the best option.</li>
	<li>Even in a pre-recorded video, people will still help you find the typos in your code.</li>
	<li>Questions can take longer than the session the questions are about.</li>
	<li>Delphi developers really are amazing!</li>
</ul>
And some answers to frequently asked questions:
<ul>
	<li>The code will usually be on the presenters blog.</li>
	<li>Replays will be a couple weeks.</li>
	<li>Turn on <strong>"Use Host GPU"</strong> in your <em>Android emulator</em> and don't run your <a href="http://delphi.org/2013/09/debugging-against-a-remote-android-emulator/">VM in an Emulator</a>. Better yet, buy an <a href="http://www.ebay.com/bhp/nexus-7-16gb">Android device</a>. The emulator is slow for everyone, which is why most Android developers don't use it.</li>
</ul>
I learned a lot more, but those were the memorable bits that came to mind.
