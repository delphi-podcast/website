<h1>Pictures from the 10.3 Rio Preview in Brazil</h1>

<p class="view">by Jim McKeeth</p>

<p>We just shared a preview of 10.3 Rio in Brazil on Tuesday, the 23 of October here at the <a href="http://embarcaderoconference.com.br/">Embarcadero Conference in São Paulo</a>. Over 750 developers were in attendance, and the speakers included many <a href="https://www.embarcadero.com/partners/mvp-directory">Embarcadero</a> and <a href="http://delphi.org/2016/03/embarcadero-mvp-of-the-year-for-2015-stefan-glienke/">Sencha MVPs</a>. I snapped a few pictures from the event that I thought I would share.</p>

<p>With a name like 10.3 <strong>Rio</strong> is great we were able to do a preview event in <em>Brazil</em> as part of their annual developer conference. I’ve been in attendance every year since I started at Embarcadero, and it is something I always look forward to. Most years the attendance is around 400 to 500. I’m sure the news about 10.3 Rio and the recent <a href="https://www.embarcadero.com/products/delphi/starter">Community Edition</a> helped contribute to the high attendance numbers this year. Either way it is great to see the Delphi developer community continue to grow.</p>

<p>I hope to get some more of the pictures I was in with the MVPs and other speakers, as well as some other general conference pictures. I’ll share those later when I get them.</p>
