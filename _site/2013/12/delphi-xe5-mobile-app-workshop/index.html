<h1>Delphi XE5 Mobile App Development Workshop</h1>

<p class="view">by Jim McKeeth</p>

<p><a href="http://www.glennstephens.com.au/">Glenn Stephens</a> with <a href="http://www.orchardebusiness.com/">Orchard eBusiness</a> has a <a href="http://www.orchardebusiness.com/Training/DelphiXE5OnlineMobileWorkshop/tabid/285/Default.aspx">Delphi XE5 Mobile App Development Workshop</a> coming up next month. It is divided up into 4 different 4 hour workshops, each on a different day. This gives you a chance to work on what you learned in preparation for the next workshop.

<p>Glenn does good work, so I am sure this is a great opportunity to anyone who wants to make the move to mobile app development.</p>

<p>If you haven’t yet, take advantage of the <a href="http://www.embarcadero.com/radoffer">end of year special offers</a> before time runs out so you will have XE5 and be ready for Glenn’s workshop. I’m looking forward to seeing all your apps in the app stores!</p>
