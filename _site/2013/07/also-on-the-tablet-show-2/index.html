<h1>Also on the Tablet Show</h1>

<p class="view">by Jim McKeeth</p>

<p>As an interesting turn of events I was interviewed on <a href="http://www.thetabletshow.com/">The Tablet Show</a> a couple weeks ago. The Tablet Show is all about developing for tablet devices, and is by the same people who make <a href="http://www.dotnetrocks.com/">.NET Rocks</a>. The show is live today as <a href="http://www.thetabletshow.com/default.aspx?showNum=94">episode 94</a>. This show was recorded when I was still a <a href="http://www.embarcadero.com/embarcadero-mvp-program">Delphi MVP</a>, before I was an <a href="http://blogs.embarcadero.com/davidi/2013/07/15/42799">Embarcadero Employee</a>, but after I had accepted the position.</p>

<p>In this episode I am interviewed about Tablet Development Using Delphi and FireMonkey. It was a lot of fun and hopefully informative. Thanks to Carl and Richard for the interview.</p>
