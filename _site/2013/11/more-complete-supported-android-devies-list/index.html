<h1>More Complete Supported Android Devies List</h1>

<p class="view">by Jim McKeeth</p>

<p>The Delphi Wiki has a much more exhaustive S<a href="http://delphi.wikia.com/wiki/Android_Devices_Supported_for_Application_Development">upported Android Devices list</a>. It also includes the new Nexus 5 (running Kit Kat), Google Glass and Droid Razr M, to name a few. At the bottom of the list there are some BlackBerry devices listed too, all of which are either not tested, or not supported. Curious to see if any of those end up working</p>

<p>There is also a link to some easy to follow <a href="http://delphi.wikia.com/wiki/Android_Device_test_environment_configuration">testing instructions</a> if you want to test your own devices, including some scripts to help automate part of the process.</p>

<p>Looking at the list it is obvious that there are more supported devices than not. Most pass over 80% of the tests too, of course it is always nice to see specific devices verified.</p>
