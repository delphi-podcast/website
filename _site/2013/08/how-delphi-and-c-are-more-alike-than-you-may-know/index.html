<h1>How Delphi and C# Are More Alike Than You May Know</h1>

<p class="view">by Jim McKeeth</p>

<p>With the upcoming release of Delphi support for Android there is a lot of interest from developers who are not currently using Delphi, most notably C# developers. Delphi provides a great solution for sharing as much of your source code, skills and development efforts as you want across the 4 major platforms, while still building high performance, native applications.</p>

<p>Delphi and C# are more alike than most people realize. I am doing a webinar to that end: “<em>A Common Ancestry</em>: How Delphi and C# Are More Alike Than You May Know.” It is the first in a 3 part webinar series called <a href="http://forms.embarcadero.com/YouCanBringItWithYouWebinar8-27">You Can Bring it With You: Leverage Your .NET Expertise in an iOS &amp; Android World</a>. The other two webinars are “<em>From One Framework to Another:</em> Leverage Your .NET Investments for iOS and Android Development,” and “<em>Mano a Mano:</em> A Survey of Mobile Development Options for .NET Developers,” by Marco Cantu and John Thomas, respectively.</p>

<p>The webinars start <a href="http://forms.embarcadero.com/YouCanBringItWithYouWebinar8-27">Tuesday, August 27th, with two a day for 3 days in a row</a>. I’m looking forward to seeing everyone online. If you have a specific question you can leave it here and I may be able to incorporate it in the webinar, if not then I will be sure to cover it during the live Q&amp;A.</p>
