<p><span style="line-height: 18px;"><span style="text-decoration: line-through;">My friend came up with</span> the 6 Stages of Debugging: </span></p>
<ol>
	<li>That can't happen</li>
	<li>That doesn't happen on my machine.</li>
	<li>That shouldn't happen.</li>
	<li>Why does that happen?</li>
	<li>Oh, I see.</li>
	<li>How did that ever work?</li>
</ol>
<p>Update: Looks like this is an <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20051023090428/http://www.68k.org/~jrc/old-blog/archives/000198.html">old</a>, but still <a href="http://mwcremer.blogspot.com/2007/06/six-stages-of-debugging.html">relevant list</a>.</p>

<p>Although you could apply the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%C3%BCbler-Ross_model">Kübler-Ross model</a> too:</p>
<ol>
	<li><strong>Denial</strong> - It must be user error! Are we sure their system is supported?</li>
	<li><strong>Anger</strong> - By filing this bug you have questioned my family honour. Prepare to die!</li>
	<li><strong>Bargaining</strong> - What if we just update the documentation? Can we tell the users this is a feature?</li>
	<li><strong>Depression</strong> - All my code is broken! I have no idea what I am doing! I'm going to lose my job.</li>
	<li><strong>Acceptance</strong> - Oh, that was easy to fix.</li>
</ol>
<p>Do you ever find yourself in these stages?</p>
