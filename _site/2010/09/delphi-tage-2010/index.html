<p class="view">by Jim McKeeth</p>

<p>Recorded live and in person at <a href="http://www.delphi-tage.de/">Delphi Tage</a> in Berlin (I’m still here for 2 more weeks for EKON too). The Delphi Tage (<em>“Delphi Days”</em>) was a short (3-day) conference organized by the German <a href="http://www.delphipraxis.net/">Delphi PRAXiS</a> community forums, alongside Embacrdero and <a href="http://www.developer-experts.net/">Developer Experts</a>.  It provided two days of preconference workshops, and a day with 3 tracks of conference-style talks on various topics surrounding Delphi and Delphi Prism . Our podcast is basically a roundtable discussion with a bunch of people involved in the conference, including the organizers (<a href="http://www.delphipraxis.net/">Daniel Wolf</a> and <a href="http://www.developer-experts.net/">Daniel Magin</a>), some RemObjects folks, David I from Embarcadero and <a href="http://www.bitcommander.de/blog/">Uwe Schuster</a> (the guy behind the SVN integration in Delphi/Win32 XE) and <a href="http://blog.digivendo.com/">Arvid Winkelsdorf</a> of Indy fame.</p>

<p>Since this was so much fun, we decided to share this episode between here and <a href="http://remobjects.com/radio">RemObjects Radio</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: The organizers of the Delphi-Tage is the German Delphi community represented through <a href="http://www.delphipraxis.net/">Delphi-Praxis</a>, <a href="http://www.delphi-treff.de/">Delphi-Treff</a> and <a href="http://www.entwickler-ecke.de/">Entwickler-Ecke</a> supported by Embarcadero Germany and Developer Experts.  – Thanks to Martin for clarifying that for me.</p>
