<p class="view">by Jim McKeeth</p>

<p>In episode 43 I have a nice conversation with Simon Kissel about his projects:</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://crosskylix.untergrund.net/">CrossKylix</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://crossfpc.untergrund.net/">CrossFPC</a></li>
	<li>Alternative <a href="http://delphiroadmap.untergrund.net/A_cross-platform_vision_for_Delphi/index.html">Delphi Road Map</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Thanks to Simon for his time and my apologies to him and everyone else that this took a while to post.</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: The links were broken due to server issues.  They are working now.  Simon reported over 1000 downloads of CrossKylix since the update.</p>
