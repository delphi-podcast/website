<h1>Delphi Live! 2010</h1>

<p class="view">by Jim McKeeth</p>

<p>Delphi Live! debuted in 2009, and it was a hit.  So much so they are doing it again.  <a href="http://delphilive.com/2010/speaker/">Great line up of speakers</a>.
I have 3 sessions planned for this year:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Silverlight in Delphi Prism - Both a half day workshop and a regular session</li>
	<li>Delphi Bots Live!  - Using Delphi Prism and Unreal Tournament to create bots to battle it out in 3D</li>
</ul>
<p>I hope to see you all there August 23-26th down in San Jose, CA.</p>

<p>Also, EKON 14 has their <a href="http://entwickler-konferenz.de/2010/speaker/">speaker list</a> up now too.  They have sessions in both English and German.  I will have 4 English sessions there:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Advanced Downloads - Great session on downloads and file transfers</li>
	<li>Silverlight in Delphi Prism - Again with a half day workshop or regular session</li>
	<li>Delphi Prism half day workshop</li>
</ul>
<p>That is September 27th through 30th in Darmstadt, Germany.</p>

<p>I am sure I will see a few of you in both places, but it will be great to see you at whichever one is closer to you.  I will be updating the titles and descriptions soon, and have some good preview information available for you as well.</p>
