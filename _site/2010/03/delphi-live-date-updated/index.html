<h1>Delphi Live! Date Updated</h1>

<p class="view">by Jim McKeeth</p>

<p>Kind of expected this to happen due to all the conflicts, but I just received an update for the Delphi Live! 2010 dates.</p>
<blockquote>Due to the rather short notice of the date, which gave some other potential speakers a bit of a hard time and because we have  received quite a few emails from the community, we have decided to shift the  dates to <strong>August 23-26</strong>. The location will still be San Jose, this time the <a href="http://www.crowneplaza.com/h/d/cp/1/en/hotel/sjcpc?&amp;cm_mmc=mdpr-_-googlemaps-_-cp-_-sjcpc&amp;dp=true">Crowne Plaza</a> in <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?hl=en&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;q=crowne+plaza+san+jose&amp;fb=1&amp;gl=us&amp;hq=crowne+plaza&amp;hnear=san+jose&amp;cid=0,0,11775983274430567758&amp;ei=8e6XS463HIyyNt_NsXs&amp;ved=0CA0QnwIwAA&amp;ll=37.330254,-121.891508&amp;spn=0.006406,0.007714&amp;t=y&amp;z=17">downtown</a>.</blockquote>
<p>Hopefully this date works for more people.</p>

<p>The Crowne Plaza looks really nice, although I am not sure where the new Embarcadero office is located in relation to it.</p>

<p>It is however right next to <a href="http://www.thetech.org/">the Tech Museum</a>, which we have had conference evening events at in the past.</p>

<p>Still no update on the <a href="http://www.delphilive.com/">Delphi Live! website</a>, and I don’t know if there is an extension on the <a href="http://www.delphi.org/2010/02/delphi-live-2010-call-for-papers/">Call for Papers</a> or not.</p>
