<h1>CodeRage 5 Call For Papers</h1>

<p class="view">by Jim McKeeth</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.embarcadero.com/coderage5/call-for-papers">call for papers</a> for the 5th CodeRage virtual conference is out.  Deadline for papers is August 17th, and the conference is scheduled for October 4th - 8th.  It isn’t a hard and fast rule, but generally speaking CodeRage is pretty close to the release of the new version of Delphi, not that anyone will be surprised by that time frame.</p>

<p>My question is, do most people who attend CodeRage also attend <a href="http://entwickler-konferenz.de/">EKON</a> or <a href="http://delphilive.com/">Delphi Live!</a>, or is it a different crowd?  I ask if people will be offended if some of my sessions are recycled. . . .  Although I am sure I will have something new too.  It is all just too exciting to not put something new together.</p>
