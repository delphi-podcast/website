<h1>Lino Tadros’ Gift of Life</h1>

<p class="view">by Jim McKeeth</p>

<p>Previous Delphi community member <a href="http://www.linotadros.com/2009/01/13/TheGiftOfLife.aspx">Lino Tadros lives</a> after his heart stopped and came out of a stroke induced comma on Christmas day.  He is home and recovering now.</p>

<p>After you read his post and wish him well, tell someone who is special to you that you love them and count your blessings.  I know too many people who have lost a loved one in an instant like that before.  Count your blessings today, give thanks to God, and remember what is important.  As much fun as Delphi development is, take a break and hold your kids, hug your spouse, call your mom, etc.  Delphi will only get better why you are away.</p>

<p>The fact the sun rose this morning and I am still breathing is a great miracle.  The rest is beyond belief.</p>
