<h1>More Questions for Nick Hodges</h1>

<p class="view">by Jim McKeeth</p>

<p>I wanted to get Nick on another episode to answer some <a href="http://blogs.codegear.com/pawelglowacki/2008/12/16/38633">questions about 64-bit Delphi</a>.  I always figure a little straight talk can clear up a lot of confusion.  Unfortunately that didn’t work out again.  Instead though, you can <a href="http://www.facebook.com/topic.php?uid=53064434611&amp;topic=6843&amp;ref=mf">post your questions</a> for Nick’s interview on Friday for the <a href="http://www.47hats.com/">47 Hats podcast</a>.  Questions you leave here will not be passed on, so be sure you leave them on <a href="http://www.facebook.com/topic.php?uid=53064434611&amp;topic=6843&amp;ref=mf">Facebook</a>.  If you don’t have a Facebook account you can leave your question and a request for me to post it for you and I will see what I can do.</p>
