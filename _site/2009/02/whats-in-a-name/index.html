<h1>What’s in a Language Name?</h1>

<blockquote>What's in a name? that which we call a  rose
By any other name would smell as sweet;
<ul>
	<li> From  Shakespeare's <em>Romeo and Juliet</em>, 1594</li>
</ul>

<p>So what do you call the language we use in the Delphi native IDE?</p>

<p>[poll id=”6”]</p>

<p>So far the voting is neck in neck between Delphi and Object Pascal.</p>

<p>In my opinion the history is Pascal evolved into Object Pascal, which evolved into Delphi.  It seems to me that Delphi is to Pascal in the same way that C++ is to C.  They both add objects and other language extensions as well as a standard library. Sure Object Pascal extends the Pascal language, but Delphi adds even more langauge extensions and also the standard libraries of the RTL and the VCL.</p>

<p>I know every C/C++ programmer I have known is very strict about referring to the language by the appropriate name, be it C or C++.  Are we being more specific by referring to it as Delphi, Object Pascal or Pascal?</p>

<p>I used to always called it Object Pascal, but I think Delphi is the way to go now.  How about you?  Let me know <em><strong>why </strong></em>in the comments.</p>

<p><em>That which we call Delphi, by any other name would be as productive!</em></p>
