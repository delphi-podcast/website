<h1>What do you want to hear?</h1>

<p class="view">by Jim McKeeth</p>

<p>After the huge popularity of the <a href="http://delphi.uservoice.com/">Delphi UserVoice site</a>, we thought it would be good to add a <a href="http://delphi.uservoice.com/pages/22253-podcast">Podcast Form</a> to it.  So you can tell us who you want to hear, what you want them to say, and how you want it said.  Then we will do our best to tackle the highest voted suggestions first, short of actually putting words in someone’s mouth (but it doesn’t mean we can’t ask real nicely.)</p>
