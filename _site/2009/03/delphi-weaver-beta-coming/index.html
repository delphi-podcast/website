<h1>Delphi “Weaver” Beta coming</h1>

<p class="view">by Jim McKeeth</p>

<p>I am sure everyone is excited about the openness with the <a href="http://edn.embarcadero.com/article/39174">Delphi road map</a> (and <a href="http://edn.embarcadero.com/article/39265">Prism roadmap</a>), and now they have announced their <a href="http://www.embarcadero.com/products/beta_programs.php">upcoming beta program</a> for Delphi “Weaver”.</p>

<p>What do we know about <em>Weaver</em>?  Well, we are expecting it will be released mid2009, and have are guessing the version as 2010.  It won’t have the full 64-bit compiler, but it will have a preview I am expecting a command-line only compiler, so no debugger.</p>

<p>It may have the new front end compiler architecture, which sounds like it might get us closer to Delphi Prism syntax compatibility.</p>

<p>So what do you want to see in the new Delphi?  New features?  Bug fixes?  Minor tweaks?  You can make your suggestions on the <a href="http://delphi.uservoice.com/">Delphi User Voice page</a>.  Then we can all vote on them.</p>
