<h1>Introducing The Delphi Hotline</h1>

<p class="view">by Jim McKeeth</p>

<p>Since <a href="http://conferences.embarcadero.com/coderage/sessions">CodeRage</a> is done and I am back from Denmark and Germany (EKON/DelphiLive) it is time to get back in the saddle for the Podcast.  Coming up next I have a call with spirit of Delphi award winning <a href="http://andy.jgknet.de/">Andreas Hausladen</a> that I am really looking forward to, and according to our <a href="http://delphi.uservoice.com/pages/22253-podcast">Uservoice Page</a>, so are <a href="http://delphi.uservoice.com/pages/22253-podcast/suggestions/278076-get-andreas-hausladen-on-the-show?ref=title">some of you</a>.</p>

<p>Something new I want to do is start taking listener questions.  Some of these questions might be for a specific upcoming interview, while others might be for nobody specific, and I will do my best to find someone to answer it for you.  Sounds exciting, right?</p>

<p>There are a few ways to submit a question</p>
<ol>
	<li>Call the Delphi Hotline at <strong>(361) 4Delphi</strong> and leave a message</li>
	<li>Send an email to questions this domain (feel free to send an audio file or just text)</li>
	<li>Leave a comment in the blog posts where I announce the next episode</li>
	<li>Post to our <a href="http://delphi.uservoice.com/pages/22253-podcast">Uservoice page</a> (or vote for someone else's question)</li>
	<li>Figure out a different way to get me your question (be creative)</li>
</ol>
<p>I am not making any guarantees that I can answer your questions, but I will do my best.</p>

<p>I look forward to your questions!</p>
