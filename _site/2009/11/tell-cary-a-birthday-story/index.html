<p>Cary is a great guy, and he does so much for all of us, so why don’t you send him a nice birthday present of a Unicode migration story.  You don’t need to gift wrap it, or even put candles on it.  If you are feeling festive when you are done, then you can eat a slice of cake (or whatever you do to celebrate) in his honor.</p>

<p>While today, November 5th is his Birthday, he is accepting gifts through November 27th, but the sooner the better!</p>
