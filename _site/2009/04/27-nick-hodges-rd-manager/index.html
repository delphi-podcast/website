<p><img class="alignright" title="Nick Hodges" src="http://www.delphi.org/images/guests/NickHodges.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="196" />Welcome to Episode 27 of the Podcast at Delphi.org for Monday the 20th of April, 2009.</p>

<p>This episode was recorded with Nick Hodges on Thursday, the 17th of April, 2009.  Nick discusses his new role as an R&amp;D manager and some of the other changes going on at CodeGear.  Also discuss the upcoming release of Delphi, the DelphiLive! conference, and some of the suggestions on <a href="http://Delphi.UserVoice.com/">Delphi.UserVoice.com</a>.</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://blogs.embarcadero.com/nickhodges/">Nick Hodges</a> is now a <a href="http://blogs.embarcadero.com/nickhodges/2009/04/14/39230">Delphi R&amp;D Manager</a>.</li>
	<li><a href="http://blogs.embarcadero.com/michaelrozlog/">Michael Rozlog</a> takes over his role as <a href="http://blogs.embarcadero.com/michaelrozlog/2009/04/17/36970">Delphi product manager</a>.</li>
	<li>Delphi 2009 Update 3 is literally days away now.</li>
	<li>Be sure to leave your feedback on the <a href="http://delphi.uservoice.com/">Delphi UserVoice</a> page.  There are four forums, so if you don't see the feature request you are looking for, it may be in a different forum.  Nick said Embarcadero is looking at all their user feedback, including User Voice.  We marked a bunch of the suggestions with updated status.</li>
	<li>Wanna see what is next in Delphi?  Sign up for the <a href="http://www.embarcadero.com/products/beta_programs.php">Delphi Weaver and Delphi Prism betas</a>.  Nick suggested that pretty much everyone who signs up will get accepted but are some pretty tough questions that you need to answer.</li>
	<li>&lt;/a&gt;Another great way to see what is coming up in the world of Delphi is to attend <a href="http://www.delphilive.com/">DelphiLive!</a> of course we have a few <a href="http://www.delphi.org/2009/04/25-delphilive/">podcasts about it too</a>.</li>
	<li>You may be surprised how much more you can get for a little more money with <a href="http://www.embarcadero.com/products/all_access/">Embarcadero's All Access</a>, which we also have a <a href="http://www.delphi.org/2009/02/23-datarage-and-all-access/">podcast about it too</a>.  They are working on the Delphi instant-on still though.  It may be a platform for a <a href="http://thedorictemple.blogspot.com/2009/04/component-itunes.html">component iTunes</a>, which would be really cool.</li>
	<li>The <a href="http://edn.embarcadero.com/article/39174">Future of the Delphi compiler</a> is still comming.</li>
</ul>
<p>The episodes with Nick are always great ones, so I hope you enjoy it!  If there are other links I missed please add those in the comments.</p>
