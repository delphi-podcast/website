What a great time to talk about how much we love Delphi.</p>

<p>I moved from Basic to Turbo Pascal back in the DOS days, and then started using Delphi with version 2. Since then I’ve used a number of other development tools, including Objective-C, Java, JavaScript, C# and others. Delphi has always been my favorite. It is the tool I turn to when I need to get something done quickly, and it is the bar which I use to measure every other development tool (and none of them measure up).</p>

<p>My son took a class in JavaScript through school. He was really frustrated with it, and wanted to give up programming. I told him I’d be happy to sit down with him again and teach him Delphi (I’d done it a few times in the past, but he lost interest). He reluctantly agreed. After a few minutes he was blown away. All the major frustrations he had from JavaScript was alleviated right away. Soon he created a mobile app that was useful and solved a problem for him in one of his games. He was telling his mom about how much better Delphi is than JavaScript when he said “No wonder everyone loves Delphi, it is the best!”</p>

<p>What about you, why do you love Delphi? Create a video, a blog post or whatever works for you, and share it with the hash tag <strong>#ILoveDelphi</strong>.</p>
