<h1>Meet HOSOKAWA Jun, our Japan MVP</h1>

<p class="view">by Jim McKeeth</p>

<p>I wanted to share a little about <a href="http://qiita.com/pik">HOSOKAWA Jun</a>, our Japanese MVP. He blogs at <a href="https://qiita.com/pik">qiita.com/pik</a> and you can follow him on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/pik">@pik</a>.</p>

<p><a href="/assets/images/2017/03/C681SPyWcAEmLpE.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2756" src="/assets/images/2017/03/C681SPyWcAEmLpE-768x1024.jpg" alt="HOSOKAWA Jun and Jim" width="640" height="853" /></a></p>

<p>When I was in Tokyo I got to meet HOSOKAWA Jun. We have a lot of great developers in Japan (and I met a lot of them at the event there), but many of them work at a company that doesn’t allow them to also be an MVP. Luckily Mr. Hosokawa works for SerialGames and they are happy to have him as an MVP.</p>

<p><a href="/assets/images/2017/03/HOSOKAWA-Jun.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2749" src="/assets/images/2017/03/HOSOKAWA-Jun-1024x705.jpg" alt="HOSOKAWA Jun" width="640" height="441" /></a></p>

<p>Don’t let his boyish good looks fool you, he is a senior software developer who started programming with Delphi in University. He’s worked with artificial intelligence and currently has an interest in virtual reality and mixed reality. While I was talking with him at dinner he showed me some components and development tools he’s created to make mobile app development a whole lot easier.</p>

<p>He was involved in the development of the Saitobaru Archaeological Museum of Miyazaki Prefecture <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRqFYQrxY9o">BeaconFence powered app too</a>.</p>

<p>Here is a little interview I did with him so you can learn more about him (translated from Japanese)</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What I do</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I develop applications and games. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I use mainly Unity for game development, however I develop tools, components and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">plugins with Delphi &amp; C/C++.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="http://www.serialgames.co.jp/"><img class="alignright " src="http://www.serialgames.co.jp/assets/images/2015/02/%E3%82%AF%E3%83%AA%E3%83%83%E3%83%97%E3%83%9C%E3%83%BC%E3%83%8901.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="212" /></a>Recently, I am often doing more innovative development beyond games and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">applications. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">For examples, I am developing applications for VR/MR (Virtual Reality / Mixed Reality) devices such as Oculus rift and HoloLens. Also developmenting more technically complex algorithms and libraries.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Where I work</span></h2>
<h2><a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Daiichhisega.jpg"><img class=" alignright" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/ff/Daiichhisega.jpg" alt="GiGO, a Sega arcade in Akihabara" width="300" height="400" /></a></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I work for <a href="http://www.serialgames.co.jp/">SERIALGAMES Inc.</a> located in Akihabara, which is a state-of-the-art city of techno pop culture.  We hope to convey cutting-edge excitement by having our headquarters there.  </span></p>

<p>[<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akihabara">Akihabara</a> is a shortening of Akibagahara (“autumn leaf field”) after Akiba, a fire controlling deity. It is nicknamed Akihabara Electric Town (Akihabara Denki Gai). It is considered by many to be an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otaku">otaku</a> cultural center and a shopping district for video games, anime, manga, and computer goods.]</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">My background in development</span></h2>
<p>When I was a junior high school student I started programing for the first time using BASIC. I started using Turbo Pascal 5.0 in a high school computer room. It is around this time that I also started working in assembly language and C / C++. When I entered university I studied artificial intelligence and produced evolution simulation of virtual life. I remember that Delphi 1.0 was released around this time, I was absorbed in programming. Of course, my artificial intelligence and other projects were developed in Delphi. Also, like many students, I love games and playing games when not sleeping.</p>

<p>And now, I am at a game production company where I can use state-of-the-art technology with artificial intelligence and virtual life technology.</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What sort of development I am interested in</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The technology I think that is particularly interesting recently is HoloLens / Windows Mixed Reality. When you can create HoloLens applications in Delphi there will be a lot of great apps.  </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What I am excited about in the future</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think mobile devices such as Android and iOS are transitional technologies.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ten years ago, as we could not imagine the iPhone. New hardware, software, and technology will surely appear in the next decade that we can’t imagine today. And I will be very happy to develop for it with Delphi.</span></p>
