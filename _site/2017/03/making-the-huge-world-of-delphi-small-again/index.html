<h1>Making the Huge World of Delphi Small Again</h1>

<p class="view">by Jim McKeeth</p>

<p>The world of Delphi is HUGE. It love seeing all the different types of apps being built and seeing users all over the world. This week I was in Tokyo for their <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/0315INTOKYO">#0315inTokyo</a> event announcing 10.2 Tokyo <em>coming soon</em>. In a surprising turn of events Eric Bonilha of <a href="http://www.digifort.com">Digifort</a> from Brazil was in Tokyo on vacation too.</p>

<p>He stopped by the Tokyo office of Embarcadero for a quick visit. He showed off the latest version of his <a href="https://www.embarcadero.com/case-study/digifort-ip-surveillance-system-case-study">Digifort Mobile client</a> and the engineers here showed him some of the things they are working on with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRqFYQrxY9o&amp;vl=en">BeaconFence for a local museum</a>. A lot of fun.</p>

<p>We are all excited for the upcoming 10.2 Tokyo release adding support for Linux!</p>

<p>It is happenstance meetings like this that show how global Delphi and Embarcadero really are.</p>

<p><strong>Go Delphi!</strong></p>
