<h1>Delphi Tokyo 10.2 Wallpaper</h1>

<p class="view">by Jim McKeeth</p>

<p>I’ve had a few requests for my Delphi Tokyo 10.2 wallpaper that I made. I found out that while this is a picture of Mt. Fuji in the background, this photo is from the Kyoto side, not the Tokyo side. I got the photo from <a href="https://pixabay.com/en/japan-pagoda-fuji-volcano-1902834/">Pixabay</a>, which is a great free clip art site. They have many more <a href="https://pixabay.com/en/photos/?q=tokyo+tower">Tokyo</a>, <a href="https://pixabay.com/en/photos/?q=japan">Japan</a> and <a href="https://pixabay.com/en/photos/?q=fuji">Mt Fuji</a> themed images if you want to make your own wallpaper.</p>

<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2777" src="/assets/images/2017/03/TokyoWallpaper1-1024x556.jpg" alt="Delphi Tokyo 10.2 Wallpaper" width="640" height="348" />I purchased the sunglasses wearing spartan penguin from a different clipart site. The tattoo and scary eyes came from our internal creative team. I forget which one, but I’ve gotten a lot of mileage out of him. You can download my <a href="/assets/images/2017/03/TokyoWallpaper1.psd">Photoshop file for this wallpaper</a> if you want to tweak it.</p>

<p>Here is another <a href="http://imgur.com/a/u1AEB">collection of logos</a> I put together for the <a href="https://community.embarcadero.com/competitions/11-delphi-10-2-t-shirt-challenge">T-Shirt contest</a>. Pixabay also has pictures of <a href="https://pixabay.com/en/photos/?q=speed">speed</a>, <a href="https://pixabay.com/en/photos/?q=power">power</a>, and <a href="https://pixabay.com/en/photos/?q=success">success</a>. I especially like this one:</p>

<p><a href="https://pixabay.com/en/suit-business-man-business-man-673697/"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2779" src="/assets/images/2017/03/suit-673697_1280-1024x682.jpg" alt="Code Monkey Need Banana" width="640" height="426" /></a>What terms do you use to describe Delphi, C++Builder, RAD Studio and the new 10.2 release? I’d love to see your wallpapers too!</p>
