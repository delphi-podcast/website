<h1>Updated Delphi Logos</h1>

<p class="view">by Jim McKeeth</p>

<p>I actually wanted a “Built for Delphi” logo so I went to the <a title="CodeGear &quot;built with&quot; and &quot;powered by&quot; logos" href="http://dn.codegear.com/article/37476" target="_blank">official Delphi logos page</a>.  I noticed they all still said ”<em>From Borland</em>,” and that just won’t work anymore.  I realize the folks at CodeGear are busy getting Delphi 2009 finished up, so I figured I could update at least the Delphi logos. I also created a <em>Built For Delphi</em> button.  </p>

<p>I present the following updated logos for your downloading pleasure:</p>
<div>

<img class="alignnone" title="Powered by Delphi 320 x 92" src="http://www.delphi.org/images/delphi/buttons/PoweredByDelphi320.png" alt="" width="320" height="92" />

<img class="alignnone" title="Built with Delphi 320 x 91" src="http://www.delphi.org/images/delphi/buttons/BuiltWithDelphi320.png" alt="" width="320" height="91" />

<strong><em>New:</em></strong>

<img class="alignnone" title="Build For Delphi button" src="http://www.delphi.org/images/delphi/buttons/BuiltForDelphi320.png" alt="" width="320" height="91" />

Or you can download a <a title="Download the 369 KB zip file." href="/images/delphi/buttons/DelphiButtons.zip">wide variety of sizes</a> in a single zip file.  If the size you need isn't in there, then you can resize it as needed.  (<em>Note:</em> I ran all of the images through <a href="http://pmt.sourceforge.net/pngcrush/" target="_blank">PNG crush</a> and maintained the rounded corner transparency.)

Keep in mind that these are not official logos.  Since they were provided with no significant restrictions I assume that includes derrivitive works and redistribution (similar to a Creative Commons).  Use them as you would the originals.  

Enjoy, and let me know if you want any other buttons.</div>
