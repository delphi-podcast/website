<h1>ScreenCast 1 – Adding an Explore Tool</h1>

<p class="view">by Jim McKeeth</p>

<p>This is basically an experiment with the new <a href="http://www.jingproject.com/">Jing tool from TechSmith</a> and creating a screen cast with Delphi 2009.  Just so you know up front, there is no editing, so you are getting the raw screen cast (although I did a few takes) so it isn’t as polished as my usual podcast.</p>

</ul>
<p>You can <a href="http://content.screencast.com/users/JimMcKeeth/folders/Default/media/81ce5be3-e014-463d-a251-049e89535be8/1-AddingExploreTool.swf">download the SWF</a> file or use the link above to view it online.  It is really small (5.64 MB) and should stream quickly.  Like I said, this is an experiment, so I would really like your feedback on the process so I can tune future screen casts better.</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>[<strong>Update</strong>: I took off the enclosure.  I don’t think most video players can handle the SWF file anyway.]</p>
