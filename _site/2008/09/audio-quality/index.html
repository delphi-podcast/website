<h1>Audio Quality</h1>

<p class="view">by Jim McKeeth</p>

<p>As a new podcast creator audio quality is a big deal to me.  In this last podcast I tried a few things differently to get better audio quality.  In my opinion it is a lot better, but the voice levels are uneven now - with me a lot quieter now.  The odd thing is my headphones I use when editing actually made it sound like they were equal.  Now when I am listening to it at my headphones at work it is obvious that they are unequal.  I wouldn’t have expected the two pairs of headphones to be that different.</p>

<p>I am curious how it sounds to everyone else?  Is it better?  Are the voices equal volume for you?  Do you care?</p>
