<h1>Delphi Keeps Climbing</h1>

<p class="view">by Jim McKeeth</p>

<p><a href="http://www.delphi.org/2008/09/tiobe-delphi-in-top-10/">Last month</a> Delphi was back in the top 10 for the TIOBE Programming Community Index for September.  Well the <a href="http://www.tiobe.com/index.php/content/paperinfo/tpci/index.html">numbers for October</a> are out, and Delphi has kept on moving to position #9.  It bumped JavaScript.</p>

<p>I truly believe we are in the <em><strong>Delphi Renaissance.</strong></em></p>

<p>The way the <a href="http://www.tiobe.com/index.php/content/paperinfo/tpci/tpci_definition.htm">TIOBE Index works</a> is it looks for the phrase “Delphi programming” in various searches.  Then compares the numbers for all the languages it indexes.  So be sure you say<strong><em> “Delphi programming”</em></strong> in your pages that are talking about Delphi, instead of some shorthand that doesn’t meet that search criteria.</p>

<p>That is why I have Delphi programming in my subtitle here.  Then I know it is on every page.</p>
<h2><strong>Call to Action</strong></h2>
<ol>
	<li>Update your blog or web site to say "Delphi programming" on every page.</li>
	<li>Contact the authors of other Delphi blogs to remind them to do the same.</li>
	<li>Include the phrase Delphi programming in forum posts you might make.</li>
	<li>Contact people behind other Delphi related web sites and remind them to do the same.</li>
</ol>
<p><em>Together we can take #8 in November! </em> (And in the US you thought November was just about the presidential election!)</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> If you update your site or blog to say “Delphi programming” on every page, leave a link here, and add a comment to your blog so others will see it and do the same.  If you look, C# is in number 8, and it wasn’t that long ago that Delphi was ahead of C#.</p>
