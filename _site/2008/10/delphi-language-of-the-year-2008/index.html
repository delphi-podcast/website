<h1>Delphi could be 2008 Language of the Year</h1>

<p class="view">by Jim McKeeth</p>

<p>So I have been emailing with Paul Jansen of TIOBE about the Community Programming Index.  He has added Delphi for .NET as part of the grouping for Delphi, but is not adding Lazarus because it is the IDE not the language.  I also told him I was working with the community to make sure we refer to Delphi as “Delphi Programming” and he sent me the following email:</p>
<blockquote>Hi Jim,

Thanks. For your information, I think your action has already some effect. Tonight's run shows that Delphi is #8 at this moment. There is a realistic chance that Delphi will become "TIOBE's Language of the Year 2008". This will be announced the 1st of January 2009.

Regards,

Paul

<p>When I asked him to be sure it was ok to share this information he said it was, but that I was clear that it is provisional as there may be other movement that happens before the end of the month that could change its position. I am hopping we just go straight to #7.  It is a very exciting possibility, and great to know that our efforts are paying off already.</p>

<p>Additionally, Neil Moffatt of <a href="http://www.DelphiBasics.co.uk/">DelphiBasics.co.uk</a> has updated most every page there to say Delphi Programming and I am working with the Sysops for the <a href="http://delphi.wikia.com/wiki/Delphi_Wiki">Delphi Wiki</a> to get it updated to the <em>Delphi Programming Wiki. </em>The comments on my <a href="http://www.delphi.org/2008/10/the-many-faces-of-delphi/">last couple</a> <a href="http://www.delphi.org/2008/10/delphi-keeps-climbing/">posts show</a> that a lot of other people are updating their blogs and sites as well.  Keep in mind, as <a href="http://www.drbob42.com/">Dr. Bob</a> pointed out, it might take a bit before Google indexes your site again (might be worth setting up a Google site map if you haven’t already) the sooner you update the better!</p>

<p>Where else can we encourage to update to Delphi Programming?  If you have been meaning to start a Delphi Blog now is the time!  Not only do we stand to pass C#, but we could be <em>Language of the Year!</em></p>
