<p>Thanks to B. Peuthert who pointed out that we can learn more about the original adventures of <a href="http://dn.codegear.com/article/20297">Turboman</a> in the <a href="http://dn.codegear.com/museum">CodeGear Museum</a>!  Now if we can just get him to snap some pictures of him with his inflatables!  I’d love to post them here!</p>

<p>My son is really getting into this superhero stuff.  He suggested Courageous CodeGear as the group all the superheroes belong to.</p>

<p>Anyone else have any developer super hero swag?  Send me a picture or a link and I will post it here.  Or maybe you have a new superhero / supervillian name or original artwork?  Just leave me a comment!</p>
