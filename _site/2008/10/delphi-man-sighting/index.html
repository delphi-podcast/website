<h1>Delphi Man Sighting</h1>

<p class="view">by Jim McKeeth</p>

<p>Delphi Man has been sighted in Germany at <a href="http://www.vario-software.de/">Vario Software</a>, makers of the <a href="http://www.ticare.de/">Ticare bug tracking software</a> for Delphi with Delphi!  Benjamin Peuthert sent me a picture of his team with Delphi Man and Dr. Deadline.  Notice how they keep the two of them separated so they don’t do battle during the picture!</p>

<p>[caption id=”attachment_383” align=”aligncenter” width=”512” caption=”In the front from left to right: Sascha, Benjamin and Nedeljka.  In the middle: Andreas and Thorsten.  In the back:  Olaf. Assuming you know Delphi Man and Doctor Deadline. (Click for larger)”]<a href="/assets/images/2008/10/team_ticare.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-383" title="Team Ticare at Vario Software" src="/assets/images/2008/10/team_ticare.jpg" alt="In the front are Sascha, Benjamin and Nedeljka, in the middle are Andreas and Thorsten and in the back is Olaf.   (Click for larger)" width="512" height="409" /></a>[/caption]</p>

<p>I asked Benjamin to tell me a little about their bug tracking software and he told me (edited and formatted by me):</p>
<blockquote>The most important feature at the moment is the Delphi plug-in, but some more cool and Delphi exclusive features are already in development.  You have a list of your tasks in the IDE and can enter the time spent for a task directly in Delphi.  Here are some <a href="http://www.ticare.de/ticare-in-delphi-einbinden/">screen shots</a>.

.

I hope we finish the translation within the next two weeks. But yes, at the moment information is only available in German. Check out the <a href="http://www.ticare.de/">product information</a> is located, or information about <a href="http://www.vario-software.de/">our company</a>.</blockquote>
<p>Thanks to Benjamin and his whole team!  I look forward to hearing more about this great Delphi add-in, which I am sure Delphi Man uses in his battle against Dr. Deadline.</p>

<p>I love hearing about successful Delphi teams and seeing pictures of happy developers!  Anyone else out there with Delphi Man inflatables who wants to send me a picture?</p>
