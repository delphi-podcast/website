<h1>Getting the Latest JCL and JVCL</h1>

<p class="view">by Jim McKeeth</p>

<p>I went to install the latest <a href="http://homepages.codegear.com/jedi/jvcl/">JVCL</a> today for Delphi 2009.  I was surprised that <a href="http://delphi-jedi.org/">JEDI</a> stopped offering one download with both the <a href="http://homepages.codegear.com/jedi/jcl/">JCL</a> and JVCL.  So I downloaded both, installing JCL first since it is required by JVCL.  Well, JVCL gave me an error that I had the wrong version of the JCL installed.</p>

<p>So I went back to <a href="http://sourceforge.net/">Sourceforge</a> to look if I grabbed the wrong one.  Sure enough, I had the September 9th version of each.  I tried again, and it still didn’t work.  So I figured I would get the latest from Subversion.  After I installed the subversion client I discovered links to download the latest versions via the subversion web interface as a tar.gz file (no need to connect via subversion.)  The links are not obvious, but really useful in my opinion, so I thought I would share them here:</p>

<p>[<strong>Check out the official daily link in the comments!</strong>]</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://jcl.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/jcl/trunk/jcl.tar.gz?view=tar">Latest JCL</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://jvcl.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/jvcl/trunk/jvcl.tar.gz?view=tar">Latest JVCL</a></li>
</ul>
<p>One thing that is missing is the JVCL help, which you can <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=45786">download seperately</a> (along with demos, etc.)</p>

<p>If you don’t have something that can open a tar.gz then get <a href="http://www.7zip.org/">7Zip</a>.  It does a two step process (extract the tar from the gz, then extract the files from the tar), but it gets the job done.</p>

<p>Hope that helps.  Maybe I missed something and there is an easier way to get these packages. . . .</p>
