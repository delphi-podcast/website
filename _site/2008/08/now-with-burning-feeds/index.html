<h1>Now with Burning Feeds</h1>

<p>I’ve been tracking my traffic and I am getting a pretty heafty amount of traffic on my feeds.  So I have setup 3 new <a href="http://www.FeedBurner.com/" target="_blank">FeedBurner</a> feeds.  This should alleviate some of the server load, and also provide a lot of great support to the subscribers.  If you have any trouble or would like a new feed with the content sliced up differently, please let me know . . ..</p>
