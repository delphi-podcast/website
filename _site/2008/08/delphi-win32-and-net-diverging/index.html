<h1>Delphi Win32 and .NET Diverging</h1>

<p class="view">by Jim McKeeth</p>

<p>I was really expecting someone to pick this up from the <a href="http://www.delphi.org/2008/08/episode-2-nick-hodges/">podcast</a> and mention it.  If you listen at about <strong>15:56</strong> in the podcast, we hear Nick say the following about the .NET Roadmap.</p>
<blockquote>Historically one of our strong .NET stories has been close compatibility with the .NET and Win32 compilers.  But as we have evaluated that we have found that doing that is kind of holding both compilers back to a certain degree.  And that compatibility story not as compelling as it necessarily was.  And so what we are looking at instead is a solution that departs or sort of begins to <em>diverge away from that compatibility </em>story.  And starts heading more towards <strong>complete support for the .NET framework </strong>kind of thing.  And so you’ll be seeing more information about that in the coming weeks.</blockquote>
<p>Does this strike anyone else as huge news, or are you all just more patient then I am in waiting for the .NET roadmap?</p>

<p>What do you all think?</p>
