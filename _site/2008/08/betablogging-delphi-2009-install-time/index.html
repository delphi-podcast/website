<h1>BetaBlogging – Delphi 2009 Install Time</h1>

<p class="view">by Jim McKeeth</p>

<p>A few other bloggers have mentioned the install time being much faster, but I wanted to get a good measurement last night.  In a fully patched XP SP3 VM with the prerequisites already installed (which does <strong><em>not</em></strong> include the .NET SDK), I started timing after finishing all the configuration.</p>

<p><strong>Results: </strong>Just shy of 10 minutes.  I glanced away for a second right before it finished, so I don’t know the timing for sure.  I recorded a video though so I could verify it.  I’ll see about posting it later.</p>

<p>Keep in mind this is a beta, and subject to change, although I can hardly imagine the install getting slower in the release.  If anything it might get faster.  Well, unless the bundle more goodness with it.</p>

<p>The exclusion of the .NET SDK is great though.  Of course you can install it if you want it I guess.</p>
