<h1>Delphi Prism / Oxygene Questions</h1>

<p class="view">by Jim McKeeth</p>

<p>Monday’s podcast will feature an interview with <a href="http://www.remobjects.com/" target="_blank">RemObject</a>’s <a href="http://blogs.remobjects.com/blogs/mh" target="_blank">marc hoffman</a>.  <a href="http://www.codegear.com/products/delphi/prism">Delphi Prism</a> has been released, and it is powered by the <a href="http://www.remobjects.com/oxygene.aspx#2">RemObjects Oxygene</a> compiler.   If you have any questions about the Oxygene Compiler then this is your opportunity to ask them of marc, as he is the Chief Software Architect for RemObjects.</p>

<p>Please, leave your questions in the box below, and I will cover what I can with marc.  Remember, keep your questions focused on Oxygene and RemObjects as marc won’t be able to answer questions on behalf of <a href="http://www.Codegear.com/">CodeGear</a> or <a href="http://www.Embarcadero.com/">Embarcadero</a>.</p>
