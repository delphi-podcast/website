<h1>What You Need To Know #1</h1>

<p class="view">by Jim McKeeth</p>

<p>Do you know the song “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iwuy4hHO3YQ">Video Killed The Radio Star</a>”? It seems like today it is “<a href="https://twitter.com/JimMcKeeth">Twitter</a> &amp; <a href="https://plus.google.com/+JimMcKeeth">G+</a> killed the blog post.” I thought I would summarize some of the recent news I’ve posted elsewhere.</p>

<ul>
	<li><a href="http://www.bittime.it/">bit Time Lab</a> has a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn-9_OOGMmE">video</a> showing off their multi-touch bluetooth app that controls a very small mini-cooper. They developed the libraries for multi-touch support and bluetooth they used with Appmethod (Object Pascal). Very cool!</li>
	<li>Project Indy has an <a href="http://www.monien.net/important-ssl-update-available-for-indy/">OpenSSL update</a> for the Heartbleed vulnerability.</li>
	<li>InterBase uses OpenSSL, but was <a href="http://blogs.embarcadero.com/stephenball/2014/04/10/openssl-and-interbase-all-is-ok/">never vulnerable to Heartbleed</a>.</li>
	<li>I'll be at <a href="http://www.delphideveloperdays.com/">Delphi Developer Days</a> in Chicago and D.C. and we will have free evening events there too. These are great events full of fabulous content (I've attended in the past). I highly recommend you check them out. I'll be showing Delphi working with Google Glass, Brain-Computer Interface, FireDAC, REST, and anything else I can squeeze in.</li>
	<li>I'm also traveling to India and South Korea this month.</li>
	<li>I worked with Sarina on this <a href="http://community.embarcadero.com/index.php/article/articles-tutorials/155-cloud/938-accessing-data-on-parse-com-using-the-rest-framework-in-appmethod">Tutorial for accessing Parse.com</a> from Appmethod Object Pascal with the REST components. Great technology.</li>
	<li>Eric compiled a partial list of <a href="https://forums.embarcadero.com/thread.jspa?threadID=103119&amp;tstart=0">over 100 Delphi apps in the Play Store</a>.</li>
	<li>Eric Bonilha was featured in the Brazilian News for his work on a DigiFort app for Google Glass that stream live video to and from Google Glass. It is in Portuguese, but you can see some live demos of the app starting <a href="http://www.sbt.com.br/sbtvideos/media/9593a5c871eb93cca2939bd3e49cdf04/Jornal-do-SBT-19-de-marco-Bloco-01.html">at just after 7 minutes in</a>. All the software used to stream video and control cameras in that segment is written in Delphi by Eric and his team.</li>
	<li>Curious about what is coming in XE6? There is a <a href="http://forms.embarcadero.com/RADXE6Webinar4-16?cid=701G0000000tKTx">RAD Studio XE6 Sneak Peak</a> event taking place April 16th. It looks really exciting!</li>
	<li>I still get people asking about the new upgrade pricing. Check out the <a href="http://www.embarcadero.com/products/recharge-program-for-rad-studio-delphi-and-cbuilder">new License Recharge Program</a> - if you own the latest version of Delphi, RAD Studio, or C++Builder then you qualify to save a lot of money when a new product is released.</li>
	<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/100444051178499170499/">David Intersimone</a> and <a href="https://plus.google.com/+JimMcKeeth">myself</a> are running regular Google Hangout On-Air events. These are informal technical events we share some of the things we've been working on recently. Make sure you join the <a href="https://plus.google.com/communities/109254669737886665453">Embarcadero Technologies G+ community</a> so you can be involved in the next one. The first two were experiments, we plan to promote the future ones better (although they will probably remain experimental and informal).</li>
</ul>
