<h1>Thought Controlled Quadcopter</h1>

<p class="view">by Jim McKeeth</p>

<p>Last night I “controlled” my <a href="http://ardrone2.parrot.com/">Parrot AR.Drone Quadcopter</a> with my thoughts through my <a href="http://emotiv.com/">Emotiv EPOC Brain Computer Interface</a> via an app written in <a href="http://www.embarcadero.com/products/delphi">Delphi XE5</a>. I qualify “controlled” in that my flight pattern was a little irregular and short before I crashed it. It was a “look mom, no hands” moment though as the drone was clearly responding to my thoughts for the few seconds before it crashed. I’ve got a lot of work to do in improving the process, so I will be posting code and videos soon. If you want to get a start on it though, it is based on my work from the <a href="http://www.embarcadero.com/rad-in-action/programming-devices-and-gadgets">Devices and Gadgets webinar</a>.</p>

<p>I’m presenting tomorrow at <a href="http://boisecodecamp.com/">Boise Code Camp</a> on “<a href="http://lanyrd.com/2014/bcc2014/scxzdm/">Is Thought the Future of Wearable Input?</a>” and if all goes well I’ll have a brief demonstration of the tech in action. If you are in the area my presentation is at 11 AM in the Special Events Center at <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Boise+State+University/@43.6036,-116.208706,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x54aef8f67c7b20c9:0x24ab5b246f9bb356">Boise State University</a>.</p>
