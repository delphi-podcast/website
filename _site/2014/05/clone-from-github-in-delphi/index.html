<h1>Clone from GitHub in Delphi IDE</h1>

<p class="view">by Jim McKeeth</p>

<p>There are a lot of interesting Delphi projects showing up on <a href="http://www.GitHub.com/">GitHub</a>. GitHub offers a convenient <strong>Download ZIP</strong> function, not to mention a very easy to use <a href="https://windows.github.com/">Windows Desktop Client</a> that has full support for managing local repositories, syncing them to GitHub and accessing GitHub projects via <strong>Cloning in Desktop</strong>.</p>

<p>Sometimes it is nice to just open the project in your <a href="http://www.embarcadero.com/products/rad-studio">IDE of choice</a> directly from GitHub. Turns out this is just as easy as 1-2-3. Right above the <em>Clone in Desktop</em> and <em>Download ZIP</em> buttons there is a <strong>checkout URL</strong> with support for Subversion. Simple click Subversion, then click copy URL and your can then open the GitHub project directly from the Delphi or RAD Studio IDE.</p>

<p><a href="/assets/images/2014/05/github-subversion.png"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1694" src="/assets/images/2014/05/github-subversion-1024x740.png" alt="github-subversion" width="620" height="448" /></a></p>

<p>This maintains the revision history locally so you can browse it from the history tab, but it doesn’t appear to allow checking changes back in.</p>

<p>You probably want to update the SVN client RAD Studio uses. This is easy enough too. Just download and install the <a title="Colab Subversion" href="http://www.collab.net/downloads/subversion">Colab SVN 32-bit Windows client</a> (don’t get 64-bit or Edge) and install it normally. Then edit your Registry and browse to “HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Embarcadero\BDS\14.0\Subversion” and add a string value named SvnDllDir. This value of SvnDllDir should be the path to your SVN client install. Something like “C:\Program Files (x86)\Subversion Client” (without the quotes).</p>

<p>If you don’t like the fact the Colab Subversion site requires a login, there are other sources for download the Subversion command-line client. Just be sure you get the 32-bit version since the IDE is 32-bit. You may have luck with with the command-line tools that come with <a href="http://tortoisesvn.net/">TortoiseSVN</a>, or I’ve tested it with the <a href="http://svn-ref.assembla.com/download-clients.html">Command-line client from Assembla</a> and found it worked fine.</p>
