<p>Tomorrow is the start of <a href="http://www.embarcadero.com/coderage">CodeRage 8 C++</a>, which is a lot like regular CodeRage, but with an emphasis on C++Builder. This time there is a lot of coverage on the new iOS support, as well as the new REST Components and FireDAC data access.</p>

<p>It all starts with <a href="http://www.embarcadero.com/coderage/coderage-8-c-plus-plus-sessions">JT’s opening keynote at 6:00 AM Pacific Time</a>, which may also be of interest to Delphi developers who want to get some glimmers of future plans, roadmaps and announcements. Actually most of the sessions will have content of interest to Delphi developers, especially if you’ve missed some of the more recent CodeRage conferences. But if you are a C++ developers, then be sure to make time for all the sessions!</p>
