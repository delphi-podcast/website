<h1>XE5 REST Debugger Supercharged</h1>

<p class="view">by Jim McKeeth</p>

<p>Some people asked for the source code to using the new XE5 REST Client Library to consume the <a href="http://delphi.org/2014/02/rest-and-the-kimono/">Kimono web service</a>. The crazy thing is there isn’t any. I decided to make a video about how easy it is to consume REST web services the the new REST Client Library and the REST Debugger. In the process I thought of a way to make it even easier by supercharging the Rest Debugger (source code below).</p>

<p>In this video I show you how to create a REST Web service with Kimono Labs (in beta, so it will change) and then bind that data to your XE5 app using the REST Debugger.</p>

<p>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKMI73-xGdc</p>

<p>You can supercharge your REST Debugger too. The source code is installed with XE5</p>
<blockquote>C:\Program Files (x86)\Embarcadero\RAD Studio\12.0\source\data\rest\restdebugger</blockquote>
<p>You will want to copy it somewhere else before modifying it. Then add a button where ever you want, and on the click event for the button add the following code:</p>

<p>[delphi light=”True”]StreamToClipboard([RESTClient, RESTRequest, RESTResponse, RESTResponseDataSetAdapter, RESTClient.Authenticator]);[/delphi]</p>

<p>And then download <a href="/assets/images/2014/02/uCopyComponents.zip">uCopyComponents.pas</a> and add it to your project and uses clause. It is pretty simple, but is designed specifically to work with non-visual components, although could be modified to work with visual components too.</p>

<p>If you want to include the TClientDataSet in the copy, then add it to the array (although make sure it is not active). Or you could modify it to add a TFDMemTable. Use it how you wish, I hope it works for you. If you discover any bugs make any changes let me know. If anyone is interested in contributing to it, let me know.</p>
