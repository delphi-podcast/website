<h1>1Password for Windows is Written in Delphi!</h1>

<p class="view">by Jim McKeeth</p>

<p><a href="https://1password.com/">1Password</a> just won the <a href="http://community.embarcadero.com/blogs/entry/join-our-club-of-elite-embarcadero-developers-show-us-your-cool-apps">Embarcadero Cool App Contest.</a> It is a really cool app, and written in Delphi. You can <a href="http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20160526005914/en">check out the press release</a> or the <a href="http://community.embarcadero.com/article/news/16234-1password-for-windows-is-the-1st-winner-of-the-cool-app-contest-2">article about it</a>. I also have a little video I made with the Stefan van As (the Developer) and Mark Eaton (QA).</p>

<p>I’ve been using LassPass, EverNote, Google Authenticator, Authy and Chrome’s identity management previously, but wasn’t completely happy with that. After looking at 1Password I am switching. It is really fantastic, and includes all the features I need.</p>

<p>Who will win next month? Maybe your cool app. <a href="http://community.embarcadero.com/blogs/entry/join-our-club-of-elite-embarcadero-developers-show-us-your-cool-apps">Enter today</a>!</p>
