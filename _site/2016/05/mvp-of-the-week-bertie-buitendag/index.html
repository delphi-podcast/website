<h1>MVP of the Week: Bertie Buitendag</h1>

<p class="view">by Jim McKeeth</p>

<p><a href="http://sadelphiitschools.blogspot.com/"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-2423" src="/assets/images/2016/05/Albertus.jpg" alt="Bertie Buitendag" width="200" /></a>This week we are spotlighting the work of <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/bertie-buitendag-a9914219">Bertie Buitendag,</a> our MVP from South Africa. He is a lecturer at <a href="http://www.tut.ac.za/">Tshwane University of Technology</a>. He was instrumental in the school system adopting Delphi for early education. He also worked to develop the curriculum for teaching computer programming in basic education.</p>

<p>If you check out <a href="http://sadelphiitschools.blogspot.co.za/">his blog</a>, he regularly blogs about educational events in South Africa where students and faculty learn more about Delphi. If you check out his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyU5R32Y2p_AVSRnXT0BCDg/videos?sort=dd&amp;view=0&amp;shelf_id=0">YouTube Channel</a> you can see some of the videos he’s put together covering different topics on Delphi.</p>

<p>You can also see Bertie and some of his students from South Africa in the recent <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpUsdg05cUo">Inspire, Develop, Excel video</a>.</p>

<p>If you are interested you can check out the <a href="/assets/images/2016/05/IT-Tools-Standardisation-Implementation-Plan-Delphi.pdf">Implementation Plan for Standardising Programming Language for Information Technology for 2015</a> that provides the argument for using Delphi in schools. It provides a lot of great points.</p>

<p>It was unfortunate that a few schools insisted on staying on Java, but most of them are now standardized on Delphi thanks to Bertie!</p>
