<h1>Blaise Pascal Issue 53 with Atanas Popov Interview</h1>

<p class="view">by Jim McKeeth</p>

<p>Tried something new where I went over the current issue of Blaise Pascal with Detlef Overbeek. The video is available on <a href="https://youtu.be/zB60_tsgzAk">YouTube</a>.</p>

Atanas agreed after being asked immediately to be interviewed. That was about two months ago. About two weeks ago there was quite a lot of turbulence in the community and vendors went nervous, some people even saw some kind of armageddon for Delphi. Even the more reason to talk the new Chief, ask him all the questions about their new policy, what is going to happen to and with Delphi. An explanation sometimes even in detail follows in the magazine.</p>

<p>ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE
CREATE AND TRAIN YOUR FIRST NEURAL NETWORK
BY BOIAN MITOV
The quest for intelligent machine has started long before the first computers became reality. For centuries mechanical devices have been created to mimic human behavior, and grab the imagination of the spectators with the promises of mechanical intelligence. But only after the first electronic computers appeared, creating such intelligence became feasible.</p>

<p>The first attempts at such intelligence were focused on teaching the computers to play games and solve mathematical problems. They have proven fairly good at both tasks. However when an attempt was made to connect a camera to a motorized cart and have a computer navigate it through a room full of obstacles, it became apparent that such simple task represents a major challenge to the computer, and so began the quest for creating the intelligent computer.</p>

<p>HOW TO BUILD AN APP IN XML AND
CREATE AN ANDROID PACKAGE
INCLUDING HOW TO USE THE EMULATOR
with code and working APK
BY DETLEF OVERBEEK
In this article we will create a Multi Device Application on an emulated android device.
We are going to use the Multi Device Application we also used in Issue 4 2016 ‘How to build an app in xml’.
We also show where you could find the information to use any of your devices to run a Multi Device Application.  How to do this varies per device so we can not explain it fully within the scope of this article. However we hope to point you into the right direction by showing how to do it with a Samsung S5 -android version 5.0.1. and for the emulator we chose for the NEXUS 6 -because it seemed to be a smaller item and that might run faster…</p>
