<p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-2297" src="/assets/images/2016/04/JensFudge.jpg" alt="Jens Fudge, MVP of the Week" width="192" height="256" />This week we are highlighting <a href="https://about.me/Jens_Fudge">Jens Fudge of Middelfart, Denmark</a> as our MVP of the week. Jens is a long time Delphi developer who works for <a href="http://delphi.exotech.dk/">Exotech</a> and <a href="http://www.archersoft.dk/">Archersoft</a>. He helps organize the <a href="http://www.dapug.dk/">Danish Delphi User Group DAPUG</a>, specifically getting speakers to their biannual workshop. Jens also regularly teaches Delphi training courses.</p>

<p>Beyond software development, Jens is an accomplished archer and beer brewer. He instructs and judges archery competitions, and in 1992 he won the gold medal in archery at the Paralympic games in Barcelona.</p>

<p>I visited Jens 7 years ago as a speaker at DAPUG. It was a treat to get to know him. The following is a podcast I recorded a few months ago that will hopefully give you a chance to get to know Jens better and learn about some of the great things he does as a Delphi developer and Embarcadero MVP.</p>
