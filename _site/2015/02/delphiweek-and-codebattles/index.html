<h1>DelphiWeek and CodeBattles</h1>

<p class="view">by Jim McKeeth</p>

<p>I hope you are all as excited about DelphiWeek as we are. On Wednesday we have CodeBattles scheduled. These are a fun way to show off your programming skills. We all use a Google, DocWiki and Stack Overflow during programming. The coding challenge isn’t a trivia competition, but an opportunity for you to show off your problem solving skills and use some of the latest features in XE7.</p>

<p>It will take place Wednesday 11-Feb-2015 from 8 AM to 10 AM PST. All coding will be done online during this time window via GoToWebinar.</p>

<p>The scoring is a combination of points based on features implemented and public voting. David I. is planning to make plaques to send the winner. I think it would be great to hang a plaque in the office with the winner’s names too.</p>

<p>If you want to take part in the CodeBattle, complete <a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/3J7FWCB">this short survey</a> with your information. We are considering working with both teams and individuals, if we get enough sign ups for both. So far we already have a few individuals. It is open to all Delphi developers everywhere. Even if you are not comfortable with English, we can chat via Google Translate.</p>

<p>Interested? <a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/3J7FWCB">Sign-up today!</a></p>
