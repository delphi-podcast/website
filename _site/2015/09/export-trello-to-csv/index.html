<h1>Export Trello to CSV</h1>

<p class="view">by Jim McKeeth</p>

<p>I’m a big fan of <a href="http://trello.com">Trello</a> as a way to organize and collaborate. Recently I needed to export a Trello board to CSV. They have an export to JSON, but you have to buy a years worth of business class for the export to CSV. The business class is probably worth it for other reasons as well, but I thought I would see what it would take to convert JSON to CSV using Delphi 10 Seattle’s REST Client and FireDAC. I’m really pleased with what I came up with, and it didn’t take much effort.</p>

<p>I used the REST Client to connect to the JSON export on Trello. The REST Client is overkill for this since it is just a simple HTTP GET request, but the REST Response DataSet adapter is what I was after. This piped the JSON into a TFDMemTable.</p>

<p>Now the JSON from Trello contains a few collections (JSON Array’s of objects) so I used 3 different adapters (each with a different root node) and 3 different memory tables: Cards, Lists and Labels. There are other collections, but I wasn’t interested in them right now.</p>

<p>Once I have the JSON in a DataSet, I need to work with it. So I put down a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nkjVPOGcdw0">TFDLocalSQL</a> component and pointed it to the Mem Tables. Then attached a TMemo to the Query of a TFDQuery component, and I was able to run SQL querries against the Trello board. This made it easy to select exactly the data I wanted to export.</p>

<p>For the export I just used the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMyFEOHznww">FireDAC ETL</a> functionality to pump the DataSet resulting from the Local SQL query to a text writer which saves a CSV file.  I love the way FireDAC provides all this great high level functionality like Local SQL and the Text Writers. It makes so many tasks so easy to deal with.</p>

<p>There is still a lot of polish to do for this, but right now it does the job really well. I thought I would share it with anyone else who might be interested in exporting Trello to CSV. You could take a look at the source code and use it to convert most any REST/JSON datasource to CSV.</p>
