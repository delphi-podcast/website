# The Podcast @ Delphi.org

Like a phoenix rising from the flames, the Podcast @ Delphi.org is back. For starters we migrated from WordPress to [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) on [GitHub pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages) with a slightly modified version of [Prism.js](https://prismjs.com/) for syntax highlighting. All of the content is [markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) ([mixed with html](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/#html)), so I can easily move to a new platform in the future, or use [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/) to convert to another format. 

I'm trying to avoid breaking URLs where possible. Right now the site is viewable at [delphiorg.github.io](https://delphiorg.github.io/) but I plan to redirect the [delphi.org](http://delphi.org) domain soon.
